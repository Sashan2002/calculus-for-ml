What you should know (42 seconds)
Before you begin this course, there are a few things you should be aware of. First, it is important to have a basic knowledge of arithmetic and algebra to know how to work with equations, functions, and inequalities. Second, it is helpful to have a basic knowledge of geometry, such as basic shapes and properties, along with trigonometry and its various functions. This knowledge of mathematics will help you perform the calculations throughout this course. If you have taken a pre-calculus or calculus course in the past, this course will bring you up to speed. So let's talk about calculus.

Foundations
What is calculus? (3 min 42 seconds)
[Instructor] So, what is calculus? Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies change and, more specifically, continuous change. This branch of mathematics provides you methods to analyze and understand dynamic systems and relationships between quantities. By doing so, it allows you to find patterns between equations, such as with distance and velocity. Calculus was originally called infinitesimal calculus. It slowly began to show signs of development in ancient times in places such as Egypt, Greece, and China. Modern calculus was mainly developed by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, along with many other mathematicians. There are two main branches of calculus, differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus focuses on rates of change and the slopes of curves with derivatives. Integral calculus focuses on accumulation and the area under curves with integrals. These two branches of calculus are connected together with the fundamental theorem of calculus. In this course, you will focus on three main topics of calculus. These include limits, derivatives, and integrals. Note that these three concepts build on each other with limits as the base, then derivatives, and finally putting it all together with integrals. There are more advanced topics you can explore within calculus that will not be reviewed in this course. These include series, sequences, and polar coordinates. The goal of this course is to provide you a foundation of the previous three topics mentioned, which were limits, derivatives, and integrals. Something to note is that, like with most other mathematical topics, calculus is based on mathematical proofs. A proof is a logical argument that demonstrates how a mathematical statement is true by using established knowledge and rules. This course will not cover proofs in detail, but note that they are sometimes mentioned to help you better understand how and why the various topics in this course work. Calculus is used throughout many industries and disciplines. It is frequently used in engineering, physics, healthcare, and social sciences. It is also heavily used in other branches of mathematics, such as probability. I will mention some specific applications throughout the course, along with providing some videos that focus on a whole application. When it comes to how calculus relates to data science in particular, note that data science is heavily based in mathematics in general. A lot of the advanced topics in data science tend to use calculus, such as more complex statistical problems. Calculus also provides a foundation for understanding and optimizing many of the machine learning algorithms data scientists use today. In this course, you can expect a thorough review of the three main topics, limits, derivatives, and integrals. I will provide you with definitions, explanations of how or why things work, various examples, and practical applications. Note that many of these topics you can dive deeper into or do more examples of on your own. The goal of this course, though, is to provide you as thorough of an overview as possible so you can take it from there to expand more on your own. Calculus can be challenging to understand at first, so the main suggestion I have for this course is to take your time and practice working through multiple examples, including examples outside of this course. Before you jump in to the three main calculus topics I mentioned prior, let's take a moment to review some of the common function types you will use throughout this course.

What is the function? (8 min 37 seconds )
- [Instructor] Let's begin by learning about functions. So, what is a function? A function is an equation where all values of x correspond to exactly one value of y via some rule. Note that sometimes y is referred to as f of x, but these are both the same thing when it comes to a function. So, why are functions important to calculus? Functions are used very frequently in many areas of mathematics, but especially in calculus. In order to use many of the techniques you will learn later on, such as limits and derivatives, you will need a function or functions to perform them on. A function is made of three main components. First, you have the domain of your function. This is the set of inputs for the function. Second, you have the range of your function. This is the set of outputs for the function. Finally, you have the rule for your function, which allows you to get the inputs, their corresponding outfits by some sort of rule that has been created. So, note that with this, often the domain is notated as x and the range is notated as y. Speaking of variables, note that sometimes x is referred to as the independent variable and then y is referred to as the dependent variable. This is because x can be chosen freely from a set of possibilities, hence from the domain of your function. And then, y depends on what the corresponding x value is, hence from the range of your function. When it comes to the rule for your function, there are two main things to keep in mind. First, you need to ensure your rule always returns only one output y for each input x. Second, you need to ensure the rule is unambiguous. This means for each value x, your rule must produce the same corresponding output y each time you run the function. So, let's say you have a function with a value of 2 for x and a value of 4 for y. If you run this function as many times as possible, it should always obtain a value of 4 for y no matter how many times you put in the value of 2 for x. But let's say if you have this function run another time where the value of y is now suddenly 6. This is not a valid rule, hence it can be a valid function. So, what does a function look like? Here are a few examples of some basic functions. Generally you will have the format of a function where you'll have y or again sometimes f of x on the left side, and then you'll have the equal sign. And then, on the right side you'll have your variable x and any sort of corresponding values or functions that are being taken with that variable x. So, for example, you have y equals cos, and then in parentheses x, which is cosine of x. Next you have y equals x to the 3rd or x cubed plus 5 multiplied by x squared plus 1. And finally you have y equals 5. Note that this last function is still a function even though you can't clearly see x because essentially it's zeroed out where it is just seen as a constant value of 5. I have mentioned a few times so far in this video that you can use f of x when writing a function. This is what is called function notation. You'll see throughout this course that I will often use the function notation f of x, but you can sometimes use other letters such as g of x or h of x. What this function notation is representing is the function and its corresponding output. So in this case, the function notation f of x is representing the function and its corresponding output. Let's look at a few function notation examples. So, let's say you have f of x equals x plus 1. You have your function notation f of x which in this case is put there instead of y, and then you have your equals sign then x + 1. Let's say you wanted to get the value where x is equal to 4, so you would have 4 plus 1, which in this case equals 5. A way to have function notation with this is you then have f of 4 where your value of x is replaced by the value you are putting into your function, which is 4 in this case. And again, this will equal 5. So sometimes you'll see f of 4 equals 5, which again is just another way of notating that your function with the value of 4 plugged in for x has a result of 5. You may be wondering what makes an equation not a function. Let's go through a few examples. For example, if you have x equals 1, this is not a function since it does not have a unique value y for each value of x. Next, you have y squared equals 4 minus x squared. In this case, if you put x equal to 0, you would then get values of y equal to plus or minus 2. Since there are two possible values for y for this one value of x, this means that it cannot be a function because you can't have two different possible values of y. When it comes to representing functions, there are various ways you can go about this. You can create tables, you can list out a set of points, you can create mapping diagrams, and you can visualize with graphs. The first three options usually just state each value of x and its corresponding value y versus the last one is where you actually visually graph it. So how do you graph a function? On a graph, you'll note that you have two lines that intersect each other perpendicularly. The line going up and down is the y-axis, and the line going across left to right is the x-axis. And here you have what are called quadrants. These are divided by these two axes. So you have your upper right quadrant, where in this case you have two points. In this case, let's say you wanted to plot the function y equals x squared where x equals 1, 1 squared equals 1, so then you would plot the point 1, 1. Next you would plug in x equals 2, which would get you the value of y equals 4, so you'd plug in the point 2, 4. Once you plot out all the points on the graph, then you can connect them together with a line. Note that how you connect the points though depends on what type of function you're working with, on if it is continuous or not over the particular domain and range you're looking at. So, if you plotted your function y equals x squared, this is what the graph would look like once it is all assembled. So you'll see it looks kind of like a big U, where it's going from the upper left and it goes down to where you have that point 0, 0, and then it goes back up in the same manner on the right side. The last thing I will mention is the vertical line test. So as you saw before, sometimes there are cases where an equation is not a function, and one way you could test this is with the vertical line test. So if you look at the graph on the left of the function, you have the function which is represented by the blue line. So it starts from the upper left, kind of goes down, has a little valley, and then goes straight back up pretty quickly. Then you'll see I have a red bar through it. So the vertical line test means that if this red bar, if you move it anywhere on the x-axis with your function, it should only touch that blue line of your graph of your function once. So if you moved it back and forth, it looks like it should only touch once, so you should be good to go. Now let's look at the graph on the right side with the equation where you have a U turned on its side, and so you have the blue line where it's coming through from the right over to the left and kind of loops back over to the right. Now you have your red line for your vertical line test, and you'll notice that it is touching two points of your line of your equation, meaning that it is not a function because it should only be touching one point on that line at all times. And with this one, it is touching two points. There are many types of functions out there that have many similarities and differences in how they're handled, formatted, and how they produce outputs. In the next video, you'll get an introduction to understanding the different types of functions that you'll come across to prepare you for the following videos where I will dive into deeper detail, reviewing some of the common ones you'll see throughout this course. Let's get started.

Types of functions (2 min 38 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned what a function is and why they are important for calculus. In the following videos, you will review some common types of functions and their corresponding properties. Note that many of these functions may look familiar from your previous mathematics education. The functions you'll explore in this chapter include algebraic, polynomial, rational, trigonometric, inverse, exponential, and logarithmic. Note that this does not encompass all types of functions, but it focuses on the main types that are key to better understanding calculus and that will be frequently used throughout this course. Here you could see some various and functions that include algebraic, polynomial, rational, trigonometric, inverse, exponential, and logarithmic functions. So you'll see you have F of X equals X cubed plus 4 multiplied by X plus 9. This is a mix of algebraic and polynomial. Next, you have F of X equal to E to the X plus 2 divided by X squared minus 5. This is a combination of exponential and rational, along with algebraic. After that, you have F of X equal to LN of X minus 6. This is a combination of logarithmic and algebraic. After that, you have F to the negative 1 of X equals X, which this is an inverse function. Finally, you have F of X equal to sine of X plus cosine of X, which is a combination of trigonometric and algebraic functions. Each of the following videos will be structured similarly, to give you a general overview of each type of function. Each video will provide you with any preliminary knowledge needed, a definition of the function type, a list of any function properties, a few examples on how to calculate the function, directions on how to graph the function. And finally, a list of a few real-world applications of how the function type can be used. Functions are fundamental to calculus and many other areas of mathematics. They help you evaluate many mathematical scenarios, and it is important to understand how different types of functions operate. The goal of the following videos is to provide you with a basic understanding of each function type, so then you could take that information and expand upon it in your work and education, along with being able to better understand the following content in calculus where those functions are used. Let's start off by exploring polynomial and rational functions.

Polynomial and rational functions (8 min 21 seconds)
- [Instructor] First up are polynomial and rational functions. Before you get into those though, let's begin by understanding what algebraic functions are. Algebraic functions are defined by the root of a polynomial equation with one or more variables. These functions are made from algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Let's look at a few examples of functions that are algebraic and ones that are not algebraic. To the left, you have some algebraic functions of f of x equals the square root of x squared plus four, and then you have f of x equals x to the fifth minus three multiplied by x squared plus seven, and finally, you have f of x equals the cube root of x to the third plus two multiplied by x plus one. All three of these functions on the left are algebraic because they are found using those algebraic operations. To the right, you have some non-algebraic functions where you have f of x equals x to the x. This is not algebraic because you are taking the variable in the exponent. Next, you have f of x equals sine of x and f of x equals ln f x, which is the natural log of x. These two are imposing some sort of other function operation on them, such as a trigonometric or a logarithmic function, hence, they are not algebraic. There are various types of functions that are derived from algebraic functions, such as polynomial functions and rational functions. Let's begin exploring polynomial functions. These functions are in the form of an multiplied by x to the n plus an minus one multiplied by x to the n minus one plus all the way to plus a1 multiplied by x plus a0. Note that in this case, n must be greater than zero, and a of n must not equal zero. Let's take a look at the degrees of polynomials. So in this case, the degree of the polynomial is represented by the variable n. So if you have the degree of n equal to zero, then it is a constant function where it equals constant values such as seven or 29. If the degree n equals one, then it is a linear function. If the degree is n equals two, then it is a quadratic function. And finally, if the degree n equals three, it is a cubic function. Let's look at a few examples of polynomial functions. For f of x, you have x squared plus one, which this would be a quadratic function since it has a squared term. Next, you have f of x equals x to the fourth minus five multiplied by x to the third plus eight multiplied by x squared minus x. Finally, you have f of x equals seven, which is a constant function because the degree of n equals zero, and hence, it's like multiplying x to the zero, which just equals one. To the right, you will see what a graph may look like for a polynomial function, where oftentimes they are represented by various curves such as different U's, or sometimes they kind of come up from the left side and then up to the right or vice versa. Let's take a further look at the degrees of polynomials and what they can tell you. Something interesting is how the sine and degree of the leading coefficient of a polynomial function can determine the behavior of its graph. So in the first case, if you have an even degree and a positive leading coefficient, then both ends of the graph will rise toward infinity. Number two, if you have an even degree and negative leading coefficient, then both ends of the graph will fall towards negative infinity. Number three, if you have an odd degree and a positive leading coefficient, then the left end of the graph falls, which will be towards negative infinity and the right end of the graph rises, which will be towards positive infinity. And finally, number four, if you have an odd degree and negative leading coefficient, the left end of the graph will rise towards positive infinity, and the right end of the graph will fall towards negative infinity. There are many properties for polynomial functions, but let's review some of the key ones. First, you have the roots are values of x, where f of x equals zero. You'll hear roots mentioned many times throughout this course, so it's very important to know that you can find them using this method. Number two, a polynomial function with a degree of n can have up to n real roots. Number three, polynomial functions are continuous and differentiable for all real values of x. Number four, a polynomial function with a degree of n can have up to n minus one turning points. This means where the graph will change direction. Number five, polynomial functions do not have vertical, horizontal, or oblique asymptotes. And finally, number six, polynomials can sometimes exhibit symmetry if they contain all odd or all even powers of x. Let's pivot and take a look at rational functions. Rational functions are where you have a function f of x in the form of f of x equals g of x divided by h of x. In this form, g of x and h of x are both polynomial functions. And note that h of x must not equal zero because you cannot divide a fraction by zero and have it be a valid result. Hence, rational functions are basically a quotient of polynomial functions, making them extremely related to them. Let's take a look at what some rational functions may look like. First you have f of x equals three multiplied by x to the fifth minus two multiplied by x squared plus three, and then you'll divide all of that by x squared minus one. So this is a rational function because you have your two polynomial functions on the top and bottom portion of your fraction. Next, you have f of x equals x squared divided by x cubed minus two multiplied by x. Again, you have your two polynomial functions, even if you just have that single term of x squared on the top. And finally, you have f of x equals three divided by x minus four. Remember that even though this is just a constant value, it is still a polynomial function where you just imagine it's multiplied by x to the zero, meaning it is multiplied by one, and hence, why you leave that part out. If you look to the right, this is what a rational function may look like when it is plotted. So again, you have your blue line, and it has kind of some different curves going on, so you'll notice it has kind of a lot of different turning points in the process. Let's review some common properties for rational functions. First, the domain of a rational function is all real numbers except where the denominator h of x equals zero. These points are called undefined points or excluded values where the function f of x is undefined at that particular point. Number two, rational functions are continuous and differentiable for all real x values where the function is defined. So note that this does not work for the undefined values. Number three, vertical asymptotes appear where the denominator h of x equals zero, and the numerator g of x does not equal zero. Horizontal asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator. And finally, rational functions can sometimes have symmetry depending on how the negative values of the functions reflect. There are many real life applications for polynomial and rational functions. They can be used in economics to model revenue growth or marginal costs. In pharmacology, they can be used to model drug concentration over time. And finally, in engineering, they could be used to model electrical circuits. Polynomial and rational functions both provide a solid base for functions to work with. These functions will often be the simplest types of functions you will work with throughout this course, but note that they are still important to know and understand, even though they tend to be on the simpler side. I recommend taking time on your own to continue exploring polynomial and rational functions, especially if you still feel uncomfortable with what these functions are. Up next, let's explore inverse functions.

Inverse functions (7 min 17 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next up are inverse functions. Let's start off by exploring how inverse functions only work with what are called one-to-one functions. This is where you only get one output for each input of a function. So this means f of x1 must not equal f of x2 when x1 does not equal x2. One way you can test this is using the horizontal line test. This ensures each value of your function only intersects the horizontal line once for every y value. So similar to the vertical line test, where you use a vertical line to tell if an equation is a function or not, the horizontal line test then tells you if your function is a one-to-one function or not. So if you look at the left, you have the graph of the function y equals x cubed, which is just going up from the bottom left and then going back up on the bottom right after it levels out a little bit around 0,0. If you do the horizontal line test with this function and make it go up and down with that red line, it should only touch the line of the function once, meaning it is one-to-one. Now, if you look at the function on the right side, where you have the function of x squared, you'll then have the blue line representing the function where it is a U. But if you do the horizontal line test with the red line for this one, you'll note that it touches two points of the line for basically the whole function. This means that it does not pass the horizontal line test and that it is not one-to-one. Note that for this video, I will focus on showing you how to work with one-to-one functions when it comes to inverse functions. Note that there are some cases, though, where a function can be turned into a one-to-one function to find its inverse by restricting its domain values. So for example, with the horizontal line test, you saw the function f of x equals x squared did not pass it. But this is a function that you can turn into a one-to-one function to, hence, find its inverse. Now let's learn what inverse functions are. Inverse functions are when you have a function f of x and you want to do the reverse of that function. Inverse functions are often notated with f to the negative one of x, where you can think of it as mapping x to y with the function f of x and y to x with the inverse function. You can generally prove a function has the proper inverse function when you have f of f to the negative one of x equals x and when f to the negative one f of x equals x. This means you cancel out the functions to get just x for any value of x. Note that even though you notate an inverse function with a power of negative one, this does not mean the same thing as taking the original function to the power of negative one. So this means f to the negative one of x is not the same as one divided by f of x. Let's review some common properties for inverse functions. Number one: a function must be one-to-one in order to get the inverse of a function. Note that there are situations where you can convert a function into a one-to-one function in order to gather its inverse, so even if it might not be one-to-one initially, you can still find its inverse. Number two: the domain of the function is the range of the inverse function, and vice versa. Number three: it has a composition property where f of f of negative one of x equals x and f negative one of f of x equals x. Number four: they are reversible, meaning if f of x is continuous and differentiable, then so is the inverse function where it exists. And finally, the graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric, meaning they create a mirror image across y equals x. So how do you find an inverse function? Generally, the process is you solve the equation y equals f of x for x. Once you do this, then you'll interchange the values of x and y in your result to get your inverse function. Let's look at this in an example. Let's say you have f of x equals x cubed. In this case, you'll have y equals f of x, which equals x cubed. So you could take that f of x term out. And then, if you take the cube root of both sides, you get the cube root of y equals x. Now, if you switch your variables, you'll get y equals the cube root of x, meaning f to the negative one of x equals the cube root of x. Let's look at another example. Let's say f of x equals five multiplied by x plus nine. So you'll have y equals f of x equals five multiplied by x plus nine. Getting rid of the f of x and subtracting both sides by nine, you get y minus nine equals five multiplied by x. Divide both sides by five to get y minus nine divided by five equals x. Now if you switch your variables, you get y equals x minus nine divided by five, meaning your inverse function f of the negative one of x equals x minus nine divided by five. If you look to the right, you'll see the graph of your function and your inverse function. So the blue line starting at the bottom left and going quickly up towards the right is your function, five multiplied by x plus nine. And then you have your inverse function, x minus nine divided by five, which is the red line starting a little bit higher on the left side and slowly going over to the right where even at x equals six, it is yet to get to the positive side of that. Like I mentioned before, if you drew a line where y equals x for this, you would then get that mirror image of these two different functions, since again, you have its function and its inverse. Let's look at one more example, but this time, let's have f of x equals one divided by x. So you'll have y equals f of x equals one divided by x. Getting rid of f of x and multiplying both sides by x, you get y multiplied by x equals one. Divide both sides by y to get x equals one divided by y. Switching your variables gives you y equals one divided by x, which means your inverse is f to the negative one of x equals one divided by x. Note there are some cases like this where the inverse function is the same as the original function. So in this case, f of x is the same as f to the negative one of x. There are many real-life applications for inverse functions. They can be used in pharmacology to estimate the time when a drug concentration reaches a desired level of effect. In kinematics, inverse functions are used to provide the time needed to reach a specific position for a function measured in time. And finally, in economics, they could be used in cost and demand functions to maximize profits. This is just scratching the surface of inverse functions due to their many nuances and various real-life applications. You will see inverse functions frequently used throughout trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions throughout the course. I highly recommend taking time on your own to continue practicing how to find inverse functions. Up next: let's explore trigonometric functions.

Trigonometric functions (14 min 26 seconds) 
- [Instructor] Next, let's explore trigonometric functions. Before you explore these types of functions, let's take a moment to understand how to measure angles with radians and the unit circle. This graph is what is called a unit circle. This circle spans all four quadrants of a graph where it is in one unit in each direction, so it has a radius of 1, hence it is a unit circle. This circle is key to trigonometry, due to its ability to easily measure all the angles from 0 degrees to 360 degrees with trigonometric functions. So you'll see here you have your unit circle with your 1 radius, and it is measuring your angle with the theta sine, and you'll see that it is measuring it with what are called trigonometric functions. Many problems in trigonometry and calculus use radians instead of degrees to measure them, so it is very important to learn what these are. A radian is a standard unit, a measurement for angles using the unit circle where an angle is the arc length of the associated arc on the unit circle. This means it is a different method to measure angles instead of using degrees. This is a visualization of the unit circle with the different radians and their associated degrees. So for example, on the right side you have 0 degrees, which technically relates to both 0 and to pi. And then for 30 degrees you have pi divided by 6. 45 degrees is pi divided by 4, 60 degrees is pi divided by 3 and 90 degrees is pi divided by 2. If you jump all the way to 180 degrees, that's pi, 270 degrees is 3 pi divided by 2. And again, that then brings you back to that 0 degrees with 2 pi. I highly suggest taking a moment to review this unit circle or looking one up online to understand radians and their associated degrees. You'll notice that when measuring radians, you will start at the far right side and then move in a counterclockwise motion when measuring them. So again, that 0 or 2 pi starts on the very right and then you start to go up where on the Y axis where X equals 0, you then get to 25% of the way through of the circle, and then you get through 50% of it at the x axis where Y equals 0, and then 75% of the way through on the Y axis where X is equal to 0 but in the negative direction and then back around. Trigonometric functions give you the power to use angle measures in radians or degrees. These functions can help you find a point on any circle including the unit circle, along with help you measure the sides and angles of any triangle. Let's review the trigonometric functions you'll come across in this course. First you have what is called sine and it is notated by sine of x. Then you have cosine, which is notated by cosine of x, tangent, which is notated by tangent of x. And these are the first three main trigonometric functions. Next, you have the three reciprocals for the three main trigonometric functions. So you have cosecant, which is notated by csc of x, secant, which is notated by sec of x, and then cotangent, which is notated by cot x. So you'll note that those are shortened, much more kind of like with tangent. Finally, you have the inverse trigonometric functions, which are notated by arcsine, which is notated by arccsin of x, arccosine with arc cosine of x and arctangent, which is arctan of x. So these are how you'll come across most of these trigonometric functions. Note that the three inverse trigonometric functions can often be notated differently, where sometimes you will see them as, for example, with arcsine of x, you'll see sine and a -1 sine to x instead. Let's understand how these trigonometric functions interact with the unit circle. So here is the unit circle, and on the very inside you have your degrees. On the next level you have your radians, and then on the outside you have coordinates. So these coordinates are where they land in the graph. So in this case, your angle is often measured by theta, but sometimes it's measured by X in your equations and that is going to be what you'll be measuring with your trigonometric functions. So remember, your radius is going to be equaling 1 and these coordinates will come in play when it comes to working with the different sine, cosine, tangent and the other trigonometric functions. I highly suggest you take some time to study this unit circle with these different coordinates or look up a unit circle online or a table with these different coordinate points, since they will be very important for you to remember. Let's define the six main trigonometric functions using the unit circle you just looked at. So theta will be the angle you're measuring and you'll have your X and Y coordinates. So you'll have sine of theta equals y, cosine of theta equals X, tangent of theta equals y divided by X, cosecant of theta equals 1 divided by y, secant of theta equals 1 divided by X and cotangent of theta equals X divided by y. Note that if X is equal to 0, then both secant and tangent are undefined. And if y equals 0, then cosecant and cotangent are undefined. This is because you cannot have a fraction divided by 0. Let's look at what trigonometric functions look like graphically. On this graph you'll see two wave-like curves representing the sine and cosine functions. The sine function is represented by the red line that intersects the Y axis at 0, where X is equal to 0, and the blue line represents the cosine function where it intersects the Y axis at 1 where X is equal 0. So you'll note that it kind of looks like the same graph just shifted over slightly. And this is because again, these are very highly related functions to each other. So you'll notice that many of the trigonometric functions have a similar shape where again, they have what is called oscillating behavior with these waves going up and down. Trigonometric functions have many properties. So let's review a few of the main ones you should know. Let's start off with reciprocal identities. This shouldn't come as a surprise with how related trigonometric functions are to each other. So here you have sine of theta, which equals 1 divided by cosecant of theta, then cosine of theta equals 1 divided by secant of theta. Tangent of theta equals 1 divided by cotangent of theta, cosecant of theta equals 1 divided by sine of theta. Secant of theta equals 1 divided by cosine of theta and cotangent of theta equals 1 divided by tangent of theta. So note that it is common for you to switch between these different trigonometric functions using these reciprocal identities. Next, let's look up Pythagorean formulas. And this is due to the relation of trigonometric functions with triangles. First up you have sine squared of x plus cosine squared of x equals 1. This follows the Pythagorean theorem where you have the squared values of A squared plus B squared equals C squared. And since you have that radius equal to 1 for your unit circle, that is why these 2 squared equal 1. The other two formulas follow this where again, you can use those reciprocal identities to calculate this. So here you get 1 plus tangent X squared equals secant squared of X and 1 plus cotangent squared of X equals cosecant squared of X. Next, you have some sum and difference formulas where you can transform when you have multiple variables inside a sine or cosine function. So if you have sine of A plus B, you'll get this equal to sine of A multiplied by cosine of B plus cosine of A multiplied by sine of B. If you have sine of A minus B, you'll get sine of A multiplied by cosine of B minus cosine of A multiplied by sine of B. Now let's switch to cosine. So if you have cosine of A plus B, this equals cosine of A multiplied by cosine of B plus sine of A multiplied by sine of B. And finally, for cosine of A minus B, you'll get cosine of A multiplied by cosine of B minus sine of A multiplied by sine of B. Next up, let's look at some even-odd identities. Note that a trigonometric function is even if f of -X equals f of X and it is odd if f of -X equals -f of x. Let's start with sine of - theta, which equals - sine of theta. This means it is odd because it has a negative sign in front of sine of theta. Next is cosine of - theta which equals cosine of theta. This means it is an even function because the cosine of - theta is equal to cosine of theta, meaning there's no extra negative sign on the outside of cosine of theta. Next you have tangent of - theta, which equals - tangent of theta, meaning this one is odd. And then cosecant of - theta equals - cosecant of theta, meaning this one is odd as well. And then secant of - theta equals secant of theta, which is even. And finally, cotangent of - theta equals - cotangent of theta, which is odd. So you'll see four of them are odd and two of them are even. Let's wrap up properties by looking at some double angle formulas for sine and cosine. What these allow you to do is calculate the sine or cosine of an angle that is double the size of the angle you are currently looking at. To do so for sine you have sine of 2 multiplied by x and this will equal 2 multiplied by sine of 3 multiplied by cosine of x. For cosine, this will be cosine of 2 multiplied by x equals cosine squared of x minus sine squared of x. Let's begin by looking at an example of how to get all six trigonometric functions at the point of pi divided by 6. So here you have your radians of pi divided by 6. So if you look at the unit circle to the right, you'll see that this corresponds to the XY coordinate of X equal to square root of 3 divided by 2 and y equals 1/2. Using your definitions from earlier, this means sine of pi divided by 6 equals 1/2, and cosine of pi divided by 6 equals square root of 3 divided by 2. So with this unit circle, you'll see that all of the X values correspond to cosine and all of the Y values correspond to sine. Now you can get the remaining four by using these two values in order to get their results at pi divided by 6. So for tangent of pi divided by 6, this is equal to sine divided by cosine. So you have 1/2 divided by the square root of 3 divided by 2, which gets you a result of 1 divided by square root of 3. For cosecant of pi divided by 6, this is 1 divided by sine so it gets you 1 divided by 1/2, which equals 2. Next is secant of pi divided by 6, which equals 1 divided by the square root of 3 divided by 2, which equals 2 multiplied by the square root of 3 divided by 3. And finally, cotangent of pi divided by 6 equals square root of 3 divided by 2 divided by 1/2 equals square root of 3. Now let's look at an example where you were solving for theta. Let's say you have cosecant squared of theta plus 2 multiplied by cosecant of theta plus 1 equals 0. And let's say you're looking at where theta is in the region of 0 to 2 pi. Let's use substitution where X equals cosecant of theta, which gets you the equation of x squared plus 2 multiplied by x plus 1 equals 0. Factoring this gets you x plus 1 multiplied by x plus 1 equals 0. You can then combine this to be x plus 1 squared equals 0. If you take the square root of both sides, you'll get x plus 1 equals 0, hence x equals -1. Plugging in cosecant of theta equals 1 divided by sine of theta, you'll get 1 divided by sine of theta equals -1. This conversion to sine will then help you solve for theta since if it is equal to -1, you can rearrange this to just have it be sine of theta equals -1. So if you looked at your unit circle where sine of theta equals -1, that will correspond to 3 multiplied by pi, divided by 2 radians, which equals 270 degrees since this is at the point of 0 -1. There are many real life applications for trigonometric functions. They can be used in physics to model various physical phenomena such as modeling vibrations of strings and motion of pendulums. In astronomy, they can be used to measure the distances between stars, planets, and galaxies. In construction, they can be used to calculate the slopes of beams and roofs. And finally, in aviation, they can be used to determine flight paths to ensure there are safe takeoffs and landings. This is just scratching the surface of trigonometric functions due to their interaction with angles, various properties, and many real life applications. I highly recommend taking time on your own to ensure you are familiar with the different trigonometric functions, the unit circle, their various properties, and continuing to practice more problems. Let's wrap up this chapter by exploring exponential and logarithmic functions in the next video.

Exponential and logarithmic functions (14 min 45 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up with exponential and logarithmic functions. Let's start by exploring exponential functions, and then you will learn about logarithmic functions. The reason why you are learning about these two functions together is because they are very connected. Let's get started. Exponential functions are functions where you have a constant real number raised to a variable power. This is defined for real numbers. The form an exponential function takes is f of x equals b to the x. Note that this is for values of b greater than zero, and where b is not equal to one. In this function, b is referred to as the base, and x is referred to as the exponent. Let's explore why b needs to be greater than zero and not equal to one. If b equals zero or b equals one, then you will actually have a constant function instead of an exponential function. And if you have a negative b value, then it will provide inconsistent results. Let's look at an example of why negative numbers are not included in exponential functions. Let's say you have b equal to negative nine. So, using your exponential function format of f of x equals b to the x, you'll then substitute in your value of b equals negative nine two f of x equals negative nine to the x. Now, let's say you want to plug in the power x equals three, so if you take f of three, this will equal negative nine to the three, which equals 729. This works fine, but what if you take x equals 0.5? If you take f of 0.5, this is equal to negative nine to the 0.5, and this is the same as saying it is equal to the square root of negative nine. This is equal to three multiplied by i, where i is an imaginary number. This ends up giving you a result that contains complex numbers instead of real numbers, and that will not work for exponential functions. Here are a few examples of what exponential functions look like, along with a graph of an exponential function. So you have f of x equals five to the x, you have f of x equals three to the x, and you have f of x equals e to the two multiplied by x. Note that the e will be explained later on. And then, to the right, you'll see the graph of an exponential function, where you slowly have the graph coming from the left and then quickly going up on the right side. Something to note when it comes to dealing with powers is that a power function is not the same thing as an exponential function. So a power function is notated as f of x equals x to the b, where, in this case, you have your variable x as the base, and then your variable b as the exponent. This is because power functions have that variable raised to a fixed power. This is not the same as exponential functions, where you are raising a fixed value to a variable power. Let's review some common properties for exponential functions. First, the base of the function, b, must be greater than zero and must not equal one. If x is equal to zero, then the function will always equal one. Three, the domain is defined for all real numbers. Four, the range is defined for all positive real numbers. Next, if b is greater than zero but less than one, then f of x will approach zero as x approaches infinity, and f of x will approach infinity as x approaches negative infinity. Now, if b is greater than one, then f of x will approach infinity as x approaches infinity, and f of x will approach zero as x approaches negative infinity. There are various properties for exponents that are often referred to as the laws of exponents. These will help you simplify expressions that contain exponents with your exponential functions. So, first you have the law of product, which is b to the x multiplied by b to the y equals b to the x plus y. So essentially if you multiply two exponential functions, you can then just add their powers together. Next, you have law of quotient, so if you have b of x divided by b of y, this will equal b to the x minus y, so essentially the opposite of the law of product. Next, you have the law of power of a power, so if you have b to the x, and then that is to the y, this will then equal b to the x multiplied by y. Then you have law of power of a product, where you have a multiplied by b, and then both of those are to the x. This will equal a to the x multiplied by b to the x, where essentially you're distributing that x value between those two different values of a and b. Next, you have Law of power of a quotient, where you have a divided by b, and that is taken all to the x. This will equal a to the x divided by b to the x, again distributing that exponent. And finally, you have the Law of negative exponent, where you have b to the negative x equals one divided by b to the x. So note that, with this last one, sometimes I will notate throughout this course exponential functions in that b to the minus x format, and other times, I will notate it in the one over b to the x format. There's a special type of exponential function that appears in many real world applications. This is called the natural exponential function. This function is represented by f of x equals e to the x, where e is what is called Euler's number, and it's approximately to 2.7183. So this is similar to how Pi is a number that is often used in mathematics, Euler's number is another one that is great to know. Since e is greater than one, as x approaches infinity, so does the function f of x. Now that you have a general understanding of exponential functions, let's take a look at logarithmic functions. Logarithmic functions are functions where you have a variable that represents the exponent needed to produce a given number from a constant real base. This is defined for real numbers. Logarithmic functions take the form of y equals log base b of x, so you'll note that the b is slightly lower as an index next to that log, and that log stands for logarithm, and this will be for values of b greater than zero and not equal to one. Note that this is equivalent to x equals b to the y. You'll still have your base be notated as b. And if b is equal to zero, or b is equal to one, then it is a constant function. Note that negative b values also provide inconsistent results, hence why they are not used in these types of functions. So how are exponential functions and logarithmic functions related? Logarithmic functions are essentially the inverse of exponential functions. Since this is the case, then the following is true, where you have the log of base b of b to the x equals x, which equals b to the log base b of x. So, essentially, the exponential functions and the logarithmic functions cancel each other out. Let's look at some examples of logarithmic functions along with the graph. Here, you have f of x equals log base 10 of x. Then you have f of x equals ln of x, which, I will explain in a few slides what that ln means. And then you have f of x equals log base seven of x to the four divided by y. To the right, you'll see you have a logarithmic function. It looks similar in shape to your exponential function, but it's coming in from a different direction, where it's coming in from the bottom and going straight up, and then it finally ends up starting to curve over to the right and slowly decreases the amount that the function is going towards the positive direction of y. Let's review some common properties for logarithmic functions. First, the base, b, must be greater than zero, and b must not equal one. If x equals one, then the function will always equal zero. Three, the domain is defined for all positive real numbers. Four, the range is defined for all real numbers. So you'll notice the domain and range essentially flip, as far as what they're defined for with exponents and logarithms. Number five, logarithms are the inverse of exponential functions where you have log base b of b to the x equals x, which equals b to the log base b of x. Six, if b is greater than zero and less than one, then f of x will approach negative infinity as x approaches infinity, and f of x will approach infinity as x approaches zero. And finally, if b is greater than one, then f of x will approach infinity as x approaches infinity, and f of x will approach negative infinity as x approaches zero. Let's look at some key logarithmic properties that will help you simplify your logarithmic expressions as you work with them throughout this course. First, you have the same base rule, and this is log base b of b is equal to one, so essentially if you have the same base as the value inside of those parentheses, it'll then just equal one. Next, you have the product rule, where you have log base b of x multiplied by y equals log base b of x plus log base b of y. Next, you have the quotient rule, where you have log base b of x divided by y equals log base b of x minus log base b of y. So you note for the product and quotient rules, essentially it changes the operations from multiplication to addition where you separate them out, and then for quotients, it then changes to subtraction. So this is a really great way to separate out variables when dealing with logarithms. Next is the power rule, where if you have log base b of x to the r, this will equal r multiplied by log base b of x. This will be very important when it comes to working with logarithms and those exponential functions, and how you can move that exponent and treat it more as a constant multiple. Finally, you have the change of base rule. There are multiple variations of this rule, but a common version of it is log base a of x equals log base b of x divided by log base b of a. This will help you essentially change the base of the logarithm you are working with. Now let's explore natural logarithms, which are similar to natural exponential functions, where you are using that Euler's number. And note that these appear in many real world applications. So the natural logarithmic function is often notated by that ln of x. So ln of x is often notated as the natural log, or natural logarithm, of x. And this is equal to log base e of x, where essentially the log base e will then just merge to just be that ln. Again, this uses Euler's number, e, which is approximately equal to 2.7183. And since e to the x and the natural log of x are inverse functions, then the natural log of e to the x equals x, which equals e to the natural log of x, so again, they cancel each other out. One of the great things is you can use logarithmic functions and exponential functions to solve each other. Let's see this in action with an example. So let's say you have seven to the x equals five, and you want to solve for the value of x. So you'll take the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation. Note that you could use a different logarithm, but the natural logarithm tends to be one of the easiest ones to work with for these types of situations. So you have the natural log of seven to the x equals natural log of five. Using that power rule, you can then move the exponent out to have it be x multiplied by the natural log of seven equals natural log of five. Then divide both sides by that natural log of seven to get x equals natural log of five divided by natural log of seven, which is approximately equal to 0.827. So this is a great example of how you can use logarithms, and their properties, to solve an exponential function. Now let's go the other direction. So let's say you have the natural log of one divided by x equals 12. If you take both sides to the exponent of Euler's number, e, you'll have e to the natural log of one divided by x equals e to the 12, and this gets you one to the x equals e to the 12. Once you rearrange this, you get x equals one divided by e to the 12, which is approximately equal to 6.14 multiplied by 10 to the negative six, meaning it's a very, very small number. There are many real life applications for both exponential and logarithmic functions. In biology, exponential functions are used to model population growth and decay. In finance, they're used to model compound interest of how money grows over time. In seismology, the Richter scale uses a logarithmic function with the scale to model the magnitude of earthquakes. And finally, in acoustic metrology, logarithmic functions are used to model how loud a sound is in decibels. This should provide you a thorough introduction of both exponential and logarithmic functions, but know that there are many variations of them, as you saw with the natural versions. I highly recommend taking time on your own to continue practicing more problems with exponential and logarithmic functions and see how you can use their various properties to solve them. This wraps up your introduction to calculus and functions, but note that this is just the beginning. I suggest you take time on your own to further explore these common functions, along with some less common functions. In the next chapter, you'll learn all about the first key concept of calculus, limits.

Limits

Tangent lines, velocity, and area (3 min 24 seconds)
- Ready to dive into the first major topic of calculus? Then let's tackle limits. In this chapter, you will define one and two-sided limits, discover limit properties, and learn about infinite limits. Before moving on though, let's first explore the topics of tangent lines, velocity, and area. Let's start off by exploring what a tangent line is. A tangent line is a line that touches the curve of a function at a point and has the same slope of the function at that point. This tangent line helps represent the rate of change of that function at that particular point. This graph shows you what a tangent line looks like. So you have the blue curve, which is like an upside-down U, and then that red flat line on top is the tangent line because it is right up against that curve and it is equal to the slope at that particular point of the curve. Before calculus came around, it was difficult to determine the rate of change of a curve at a particular point due to many functions having complicated curves. This is where the topics of limits and derivatives come in handy to help you solve this problem. You will learn about this topic in greater detail in the derivatives chapter in this course. Next step is velocity. Velocity deals with distance and time. The average velocity of an object over a period of time is the distance the object traveled divided by the amount of time traveled. Now, if you want to find the velocity at a certain point, then you need to find the instantaneous velocity. Just like how it was difficult to determine the rate of change of a curve at a particular point, it was difficult before calculus to determine the instantaneous velocity of an object at a particular point. This is also due to functions having complicated curves. This is where the topics of limits and derivatives come in handy again to help you solve this problem to help you describe motion and rates of change for objects. Finally, let's take a look at area problems. There are various formulas out there to determine the area for traditional shapes, but what about non-traditional shapes caused by the curves of functions? This is where the topic of integrals becomes useful to help you find the exact area under a curve instead of using estimation methods such as summing rectangles. Integrals are perfect to use for a scenario like this one where you have the area between two curves. So here you have two parabolas, so a U looking curve and then an upside-down U looking curve. And let's say you wanted to find the shaded region where those curves intersect in the middle. That area would be a little difficult to determine if you did not have integrals. As you could tell from these three problems, the three major topics of calculus discussed in this course, which are limits, derivatives, and integrals, are critically needed to help solve these. Let's start off this calculus journey by exploring what a limit is in the next video.

What is a limit? (4 min 8 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now that you learned about tangent lines and velocity problems, you're ready to dive deep into the content of this chapter. Let's kick off with the first major topic of calculus, limits. Limits are used to define the value of a function f of x as the input approaches a defined point a. This is denoted with the following equation, where you have lim of x to a, which is the limit as x goes to a of f of x equals L. This means as your x is getting arbitrarily close to a, the value of the function f of x approaches L. This does not necessarily mean the function f of x needs to be defined at the point x equals a, just that as the function f of x approaches a, the value L exists. Note that this is not the precise definition of a limit, but that definition will be explained later on in this chapter. Let's break down the limit equation. So you had the equation lim of x to a of f of x equals L. The word lim represents the limit, which makes sense with it being an abbreviation of the word limit. Next, you have your variable x, and then you have the value you are approaching, which is a. Then you have your function f of x. And finally, your limit result L, which is any real number, or it can technically be positive or negative infinity. Let's look at what a limit can be like when you were looking at a graph. So let's say you have this curve and you see the red point at where x equals 2, you can then have the limit be as x is approaching 2. And so then you're gathering what that point equals on the y-axis as x is approaching 2. Note that the limit definition I gave you is technically for a two-sided limit. What this means is that you are calculating the limit as the function f of x approaches the value a from the left and the right side of the function. You'll learn about one-sided limits in the next video and see how they differ from two-sided limits. So why are limits so important? Limits provide a solid foundation for calculus, making them the essential building block needed to do basically any other concept in calculus. They are needed to define and understand topics such as derivatives and integrals. Now, there are times where the limit just does not work out. This is when the limit has no result, and you will then say, "This is when the limit does not exist." You can shorten this to DNE, usually capitalized, and note that this is frequently how you will see it notated in other resources. There are various reasons as to why the limit might not exist, and what it can mean if a limit does not exist, such as an asymptote or a jump in a function. This will be more thoroughly explained in the next chapter. There are various practical applications for limits. In physics, they are used in a variety of calculations, such as calculating instantaneous velocity, acceleration, and electric field strength. In engineering, they can be used to calculate stress and strain when building structures. Finally, in economics, they can be used to determine market equilibrium. This is just the beginning of limits. You'll continue to learn more about limits and see them in action throughout the rest of this course, including with derivatives and integrals. In the next video, let's explore what one-sided limits are.
One-sided limits (7 min)
- [Instructor] Now that you've learned what a limit is, let's take a step back and learn what a one-sided limit is. In this video, you'll learn what one-sided limits are and how they relate and differ from your regular two-sided limits. One-sided limits are what you calculate when you want to determine the limit of a function from just one direction. This will either be from the left or the right direction. In this case, you are only focused on the limit from that one direction and you don't care what it would be or not from the other direction. Let's take a look at the left limit first. Left limits are used to define the value that a function f of x approaches as the input approaches a defined point a from the left. This is denoted with the following equation where the limit as x approaches a from the left of f of x equals L. In this case, the left limit is denoted by the little minus sign above your value a. This means as your value x gets arbitrarily close to a, the value of your function f of x approaches L only where x is less than a. This does not necessarily mean that the function has to be defined at x equals a. What this does imply though is as the function approaches a from the left, the value of L for your limit exists. Note that the left limit does not care about what happens with values of x that are greater than a. Now let's switch gears and take a look at right limits. Right limits are used to define the value that a function f of x approaches as the input approaches a defined point a from the right. This is denoted with the following equation where the limit of x to a plus of f of x equals L. Like last time, L is the result of your limit. And then this time, the plus sign above the a is what denotes that it's a right limit versus the minus sign for the left limit. Similar to left limits, this means as your x is getting arbitrarily close to a, then the value of your function f of x approaches L only where x is greater than a. This does not necessarily mean that the function has to be defined at x equals a. What this does imply though is as the function approaches a from the right, the value L does exist. Note that the right limit does not care about what happens with values of x that are less than a. As you could tell, left and right limits are essentially opposites of each other, where you have one for each direction. Like I mentioned before, the main change in the function notation is the right hand limit has a plus sign and the left hand limit has a minus sign. And again, those will be above the values that you are taking the limit to. Be aware if these signs do show up in a limit problem that this is what they are indicating, that they are either a right or left limit. From what you have seen, one-sided limits are essentially a step down from a regular limit, also known as a two-sided limit. Since a regular limit must be defined in both directions versus just one direction, it holds a higher significance overall. Next, let's look at a more complete definition of a limit to see how one-sided and two-sided limits are related to each other. The limit of a function f of x as x approaches a defined point a exists if and only if, one, the left limit exists where you have the limit as x approaches a with that minus sign of f of x equals L1. Number two is the right limit exists where you have the limit as x approaches a with that plus sign and then of f of x, and this is equal to L2. And three, the left and right limits must equal each other. This means the limit as x approaches a from the left of f of x equals the limit as x approaches a from the right of f of x. This is also denoted by L1 equals L2. This more concrete definition of a limit further elaborates on the fact the left and right limits must exist in order for the overall limit to exist. This also ensures that these two limits must equal the same value in order for the limit to exist. Note that there are sometimes cases where the left and right limits do exist, but they don't equal each other. This causes the overall limit to not exist. Let's look at a quick example of this. Let's say you have the function f of x where it is equal to 2 for values of x less than 3, and it is equal to 5 for values of x greater than or equal to 3. Let's get the limit as x approaches 3 of your function f of x. Let's begin by getting the left limit of the function as x approaches 3 from the left. So, you will use your formula of limit as x approaches a from the left of f of x equals the limit as x approaches 3 from the left of 2. In this case, the limit of a constant value is just itself, so your limit equals 2 for your left limit. Now let's look at the right limit. Using your formula, you have the limit as x approaches a from the right of f of x equals the limit as x approaches 3 from the right of 5. Like last time, since it is a constant value, it just equals itself, which is 5 for your right limit. As you see, the limit as x approaches a from the left of f of x is not equal to the limit as x approaches a from the right of f of x. So even though the left and right limits do exist, they do not equal each other because 2 does not equal 5. This means the overall limit does not work and it is deemed as DNE, or does not exist. So you notate that as the limit as x approaches three of f of x equals DNE. Knowing about one-sided limits can help provide you a better overall understanding of how limits work. They can also be very useful for cases like the previous example where they can help you properly evaluate the limit of a function. Let's move on to some common limit properties.

Limit properties (7 min 10 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now that you are familiar with what a limit is, let's begin the process of learning how to calculate them. You'll start off by reviewing many of the common limit properties. I will list these limit properties in this video and then I'll show you how to calculate limits using these properties on the next chapter. The following limit properties I will show you include the following conditions. First, F of X and G of X are both functions that are approaching the value of X. Both A and C are real numbers that are used as constant values. N is a real number. And finally, L and M, both capitalized, are real numbers such that the limit as X goes to A of F of X equals capital L, and the limit as X goes to A of G of X is equal to capital M. Let's start with an easy one, the identity rule. The identity rule states if you're taking the limit of a function F of X equals X as X goes to A, then the limit is simply A. So as you can see here, you have the limit as X goes to A of X and you simply substitute in that value A for X, and this gets you a result of A. Let's look at another easy rule, the constant rule. This rule states if you're taking the limit of a constant value, then it will always be the constant itself. This makes sense since the limit of a number is always itself. So here you see you have the limit of X to A of the constant value C. And no matter what that value A is, the answer is always going to be C. Let's pivot to a little bit more complex rules starting with the sum rule. This rule states the limit of a sum is equal to the sum of its limits. This makes it easy to separate out functions and take their limits individually. So here you have the limit as X goes to A of F of X push GX is equal to the limit as X goes to A of F of X plus the limit as X goes to A of G of X. This is also equal to capital L plus capital M. If you remember before, L and M essentially represent the limits for F of X and G of X. Next, let's look at a similar rule, the difference rule. This rule states the limit of a difference is equal to the difference of its limits. Like with the sum rule, this rule makes it easy to separate out functions and take their limits individually. So you have the limit as X goes to A of F of X subtracted by G of X is equal to the limit as X goes to A of F of X minus the limit as X goes to A of G of X. And if you use this in the terms of just the limit results, you get capital L minus capital M. Now let's look at some multiplication beginning with the constant multiple rule. This rule states you can take a constant multiplied with a function outside of the limit. Then you can apply the constant multiple after the limit is taken. This is an easy way to simplify the process by having you just focus on getting the limit of the function itself and then dealing with the constant multiple later. So you have the limit as X goes to A of C multiplied by F of X, and that is going to be equal to C multiplied by the limit as X goes to A of F of X. You can also think of this as terms as C multiplied by capital L for the limit of F of X. Moving on with more multiplication, let's take a look at the product rule. The product rule states the limit of a product is equal to the product of its limits. Like with the sum difference rules, this makes it easy to separate out the functions to take their limits individually. So here you have the limit as X goes to A of F of X multiplied by G of X is equal to the limit as X goes to A of F of X multiplied by the limit as X goes to A of G of X. This is equal to their limit results of capital L multiplied by capital M. Next, let's take a look at the quotient rule, which is similar to the product rule where you can easily separate out the limit being taken. This rule states the limit of a quotient is equal to the quotient of its limits. Like I mentioned before, this rule allows you to separate out the functions to take their limits individually. The main caveat for this rule to keep in mind is the denominator must not equal zero. So here you have the limit of X goes to A of F of X divided by G of X is equal to the limit as X goes to A of F of X divided by the limit as X goes to A of G of X. You could think of this as terms as capital L divided by capital M, and again, remember this is for M not equal to zero, since if the denominator is equal to zero, then you cannot use this rule. Let's move on to the power rule. This rule functions similarly to the constant multiple rule. The power rule states if a function has a power N, then you can move the power outside of limit and apply it after the limit has been taken. This is another great way to simplify the process of taking a limit to just focus on the function itself. So here you have the limit as X goes to A of F of X to the N is equal to the limit as X goes to A of F of X, and then you'll take all of that to the N. You can also think of this as capital L to the N, where again, that's your limit result taken to that power N after the fact. Finally, let's take a look at the root rule. This is very similar to the power rule where this rule states if you have a function with a root N, you can move the root outside of the limit and then apply the root to the limit after it's been taken. This rule is essentially an extension of the power rule since roots are fractional powers. So here you have the limit as X goes to A of the root of N of F of X is equal to the root of N of the limit as X goes to A of F of X. You can also think of this as the root of N with your capital L representing your limit result. These limit properties can be used to help ease the process to calculate limits since they can become a bit tricky at times. Like I mentioned earlier, you will see these limit properties in action in a later video along with throughout the rest of the course. Now that she knows some basics about limits, let's pivot and take a look at a more detailed definition of exactly what a limit is by looking at the precise definition of a limit.

Precise definition of a limit (5 min 51 seconds)
- [Instructor] So far, you have learned what a limit is with a general definition, along with what one-sided limits are and how they reinforce that limit definition. Now let's take a look at a more technical definition of what a limit is. This more technical definition of a limit is sometimes called the precise definition of a limit. It is also sometimes referred to as the epsilon-delta definition of a limit. This is due to the epsilon and delta values both being used in this version of defining a limit. The precise definition of a limit states the limit of a function f of x as x approaches a is equal to L, so this is represented by the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals L. And this is for every epsilon greater than 0, then there exists a delta greater than 0, such that the absolute value of f of x minus L is less than epsilon whenever 0 is less than the absolute value of x minus a, which is less than delta. This definition is definitely more complex looking than the previous definition I showed you, so let's take a moment to break it down. The first part of this definition starts off with the typical limit definition, like you saw in the past. The epsilon greater than 0 is known as the universal quantifier. This represents the maximum allowable error difference between the function f of x and the limit L. The delta greater than 0 is called an existential quantifier. This represents how close x must be to a to ensure your function f of x stays within the error of the limit. Let's look at the two inequalities that are represented in the conditional statement for the precise definition of a limit. Your first equality is the absolute value of f of x minus L is less than epsilon. This inequality ensures the function values of f of x are close enough to the limit L. Your second inequality is 0 less than the absolute value of x minus a less than delta, and this inequality ensures x is close enough to a without it being exactly equal to a. There are few key items to take note of. First, it is important to note that there are technically an infinite amount of deltas that you can choose from. Generally though the smaller the delta, the higher the accuracy. You'll also want to note that the function needs to be defined around x equals a, but it does not necessarily have to be defined at exactly x equals a like it would with the regular limit definition. Let's see the precise definition of a limit in action. Let's use this definition to prove the limit as x approaches 2 of 3 multiplied by x plus 1 is equal to 7. First, you'll have your inequality, the absolute value of F of x minus L is less than epsilon. Now, you could substitute in your function f of x, which in this case is 3 multiplied by x plus 1. So you have the absolute value of 3 multiplied by x plus 1 minus 7, which is less than epsilon. You can simplify those two constant values to get the absolute value of 3 multiplied by x minus 6 is less than epsilon. Using the constant multiple rule, you can move out that 3 to then get 3 multiplied by the absolute value of x minus 2 is less than epsilon. Now, let's divide both sides by 3. Looking at your inequality, it looks like a good delta value to choose would be epsilon divided by 3. Now, let's bring in your second inequality, 0 less than the absolute value of x minus a less than delta. Plugging in your value of a, which in this case is 2, you'll get 0 less than the absolute value of x minus 2 less than delta. Now, you can multiply both sides by 3 since if you do that on both sides, it will essentially still be the same. So you have 3 multiplied by the absolute value of x minus 2, which is less than 3 multiplied by delta. You'll notice that 3 multiplied by delta is equal to epsilon because you had your delta equal to epsilon divided by 3. Since the absolute value of f of x minus 7 is less than epsilon, then this limit satisfies the precise definition of a limit using epsilon and delta of getting x arbitrarily close to the limit of 2. Why is this precise definition of a limit necessary with its complexity? First, the precise definition of a limit provides a mathematically rigorous method to understand how a limit works. This definition in turn is what is usually used when proving how limits work in the first place. It helps prove this by more precisely defining how close is close enough instead of simply stating it needs to be arbitrarily close when taking a limit. Now you should have a very solid understanding of what a limit is, not only with the regular definition, but with the precise definition. I suggest taking time on your own to further explore the definition of a limit. Again, whether it is the regular definition or the precise definition. Let's wrap up this chapter by taking a look at what infinite limits are.

Infinite limits (7 min 7 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up this introduction of limits by discussing infinite limits. I will discuss a few different scenarios in this video regarding infinite limits. Let's begin with a definition. Infinite limits are what occurs when the limit of a function is equal to positive or and negative infinity. This can occur for both one-sided and two-sided limits. These limits show up on a regular basis, so it is important to be aware of them and understand what they can potentially be showing you. Let's look at two versions of this. First, the limit of a function f of x is equal to infinity. If f of x increases without bound as x approaches a, this is represented by the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals infinity. This means as your x is getting arbitrarily close to a, the value of the function f of x approaches positive infinity. Now let's look at the other version of this. The limit of a function f of x is equal to negative infinity if f of x decreases without bound as x approaches a This is represented by the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals negative infinity. This means as your x is getting arbitrarily close to a, the value of the function f of x approaches negative infinity. Remember, both of these definitions do not imply the function has to be defined at the point x equals a. What these definitions do say though is as the function f of x approaches a point a, the value of positive or negative infinity exists. You can define both of these scenarios as left or right limits by simply adding the plus or minus signs accordingly to indicate which direction it is going to indicate whether the right or the left limit is going to positive or negative infinity. So what does a limit equaling positive or negative infinity imply? If the left, right, or two-sided limit of a function equals positive or negative infinity, then you can assume there is a vertical asymptote for your function f of x at the point x equals a. On this graph, you can look at two different vertical asymptote for this function, so you'll see where the value of two is. You have these blue lines where it looks like an L and a flipped L on the right and left sides, and then an upside down U on the bottom of the graph. You'll notice where the red dotted line around x equals two and x equals negative two are two vertical asymptotes. This means that this function will never quite reach that value of two or negative two for x because it is either going to positive or negative infinity, which in this case, it's actually doing that simultaneously. Let's look at a few properties when dealing with multiple functions where one of the limits equals positive infinity. Let's assume you have the functions f of x and g of x where the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals infinity and the limit is x approaches a of g of x equals capital L. If this is the case, then you can assume the following statements. So number one, the limit as x approaches a of f of x plus g of x is equal to infinity. If capital L is greater than zero, which is your limit for your function g of x, then the limit is x approaches a of f of x multiplied by g of x is equal to infinity. If capital L less than zero, which is again your limit for g of x, then the limit is x approaches a of f of x multiplied by g of x is equal to negative infinity. And finally, the limit as x approaches a of f of x divided by g of x equals zero. Note that you can simply switch the sign of the result for all four these properties if you're working with the case where the limit is approaching negative infinity. Next, let's take a look at a related scenario dealing with infinity and limits. It is important to note that you can actually take the limit of x going to positive or negative infinity. This is where you would have a equal to positive or negative infinity in your limit showing that x approaches positive or negative infinity. In this scenario, you are essentially putting an infinitely large number in the place of x to evaluate the result. There are various outcomes you can get when taking the limit to infinity, whether it's positive or negative of a function. First, you can simply get a numerical value such as zero or 10, and this is common for rational functions. Option two is you can get positive or negative infinity, which is common for polynomial functions. Third, there may be oscillating behavior where it's oscillating between two different numbers, and this is common for trigonometric functions. Finally, it can have a limit that does not exist, which is represented by DNE, which is common for discontinuous functions. Before, you learn about vertical asymptotes when it came to infinite limits, but what about horizontal asymptotes? If the left, right, or two-sided limit of a function f of x is taken to positive or negative infinity and equals a constant value, capital L for the limit, then you can assume there is a horizontal asymptote that exists for function f of x at the limit capital L. In this graph, you can look at a horizontal asymptote. So you'll notice there is a vertical asymptote at x equals zero. But let's look at the case where y equals two. So you'll see these look like two Ls that are flipped, so you have the blue lines going down, and then you have that red dotted line going across the graph showing where the horizontal asymptote is. So this is showing that the function will never quite reach y equals two because it'll simply be going out in those two directions. Throughout the rest of the course, you'll frequently see infinite limits and limits taken to infinity. It is important to understand how to work with them and what their behavior represents, such as vertical and horizontal asymptotes. This wraps up the basics of limits and their key properties. Remember, limits are a key concept for calculus and help define the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a defined point. Limits will be the key focus throughout the rest of the course, even when they aren't obvious. In the next chapter, you will explore various methods to evaluate limits.

Day 03
Evaluating Limits 
Methods to calculate limits (2 min 2 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you will explore various methods to calculate limits. Remember, a limit helps define the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a defined point. Let's start off by reviewing the methods you're going to learn in this chapter. The methods you'll explore to calculate limits are direct substitution, using their properties, using factoring, working with limits for common functions, such as trigonometric functions, implementing the squeeze theorem, and determining when the limit does not exist. Note that this does not encompass all methods available to calculate limits, but it focuses on the common methods used in most limit scenarios. The method of direct substitution is fairly straightforward. This method is where you simply substitute the value a that x is approaching directly for x. For example, the limit as x approaches 3 for the function x squared would simply be 3 squared, which equals 9. I will frequently use this method throughout the rest of the course. Each of the following videos will be structured similarly to give you a general overview of each method for calculating limits. Each video will provide you with the important definitions of the method, any properties associated with the method, and multiple examples of how to calculate limits using the method. It is important to know how to not only understand limits, but how to calculate them in various scenarios as well. Limits are fundamental to calculus, so understanding how to calculate them will help you better understand other key concepts later on, such as derivatives and integrals. The goal of the following videos is to provide you with working knowledge on how to implement these various methods of calculating limits. You can take this knowledge and expand upon it in your work and education. Let's get started with calculating limits using their properties.

Calculate limits using properties, part 1 (9 min 50 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's start off by using the various limit properties to calculate limits. You will use the properties discussed in the previous chapter. Let's first refresh you on what those limit properties are. So here, you have the limit properties starting with the identity rule. So you have the limit as x goes to a of x is equal to the value of a. Next, you have the constant rule, which is the limit as x goes to a of c is equal to the constant itself, c. After that, you have the constant multiple rule. So you have the limit as x goes to a of c multiplied by f of x is equal to c multiplied by the limit as x goes to a of f of x, which is equal to c multiplied by capital L. Next, you have the sum rule, which is the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus g of x is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus the limit as x goes to a of g of x, which equals capital L plus capital M. Next is the difference rule. So you have the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus g of x is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus limit as x goes to a of g of x is equal to capital L minus capital M. After that, you have the product rule, so you have limit as x goes to a of f of x multiplied by g of x is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x multiplied by the limit as x goes to a of g of x, which is equal to capital L multiplied by capital M. Then, you have the quotient rule. So you have the limit as x goes to a of f of x divided by g of x is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x divided by the limit as x goes to a of g of x, which is equal to capital L divided by capital M. And remember, for this particular rule, you need to make sure capital M, which is the limit of your denominator, is not equal to zero. After that, you have the power rule, which is the limit as x goes to a of f of x to the n is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x, and then you'll take all of that to the n, which is equal to capital L to the n. Finally, you have the root rule, which is an extension of the power rule where you have the limit as x goes to a of root n of f of x is equal to root n of limit as x goes to a of f of x, which is equal to root n of capital L. Let's start off with an easy example by using the identity rule. Let's get the limit as x approaches five for the value x. The identity rule states that the limit of this function is simply going to be the value it's going to. So using that identity rule as the limit of x going to a of x is equal to a. So in this case, you'll have the limit as x goes to five of x is simply equal to five. Let's look at another easy example using the constant rule. Let's get the limit as x approaches 15 for the constant value of seven. The constant rule states the limit of a constant is always itself where you have the limit as x goes to a of c is equal to c. Using this rule, you have the limit as x goes 15 of seven is equal to seven. Note that the answer will always be seven regardless of where you take the limit of x to, including positive or negative infinity. Let's move on to some example where you have multiple functions involved. Let's start by using the sum rule to get the limit as x goes to five of six plus x. So the sum rule states that you can separate out these functions, six and x, take their limits, and then add up their results. So this means you have the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus g of x is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus the limit as x goes to a of g of x equals capital L plus capital M. So this means you could separate out your limit as limit x goes to five of six plus x is equal to the limit as x goes to five of six plus the limit as x goes to five of x. Let's solve these limits separately. So beginning with the limit as x goes to five of six using the constant rule that is going to equal six. Next, you have the limit as x goes to five of x. Using the identity rule, the solution for this one is equal to five. Now, let's add your two limit results, L plus M, which in this case is equal to six plus five, which equals 11. So this means using the sum rule, the limit as x goes to five of six plus x is equal to 11. Let's take a look at another sum rule example. Let's get the limit as x goes to two of x squared plus x plus four. Here, you have the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus g of x plus h of x, and you can equal this to the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus the limit as x goes to a of g of x plus the limit as x goes to a of h of x. This is a great example of how you can extend the sum rule to work for more than just two functions. So in this case, you have the limit as x goes to two of x squared plus x plus four equals the limit as x goes to two of x squared plus the limit as x goes to two of x plus the limit as x goes to two of four. So with the first one, you have the limit as x goes to two of x squared. You can use direct substitution to simply get two squared, which equals four. For the second limit, limit as x goes to two of x, this uses the identity rule. So the solution is simply the value you're going to, which is two. Finally, you have the limit as x goes two of four, and using the constant rule, the result is four. So the limit as x goes to two of x squared plus x plus four is equal to four plus two plus four, which equals 10. Let's look at a few similar examples, but this time, let's use the difference rule. Let's get the limit as x goes to two of x cubed minus five. In this case, you have the limit as x goes to a, so you'll use the difference rule limit as x goes to a of f of x minus g of x equals the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus the limit as x goes to a of g of x, which is equal to capital L minus capital M. So in this case, you had the limit as x goes to two of x cubed minus five equals the limit as x goes to two of x cubed minus the limit as x goes to two of five. So let's get the separate limits. So you have the limit as x goes to two of x cubed equals two cubed using direct substitution, which gives you a result of eight. And then, you have the limit as x goes to two of five, using the constant rule, is equal to five. Now, you have L minus M, which equals eight minus five, which equals three. So this means your final result as the limit as x goes to two of x cubed minus five is equal to three. Let's look at an example where you combine the sum and difference rules together. This time, let's get the limit as x goes two infinity of x to the fourth plus x minus seven. So in this case, you use the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus g of x minus h of x is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x plus the limit as x goes to a of g of x minus the limit as x goes to a of h of x. This means your limit as x goes to infinity for x to the fourth plus x minus five is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of x to the fourth plus the limit as x goes to infinity of x minus the limit as x goes to infinity of seven. So let's get these three different limits. So you have the limit as x goes to infinity of x to the fourth, which is equal to infinity to the fourth using direct substitution, which equals infinity. Next, you have the limit as x goes to infinity of x, which using the identity rule is just equal to infinity. And finally, you have the limit as x goes to infinity of seven, which is equal to itself, which is seven. So if you get L plus M minus N for your limit, this is equal to infinity plus infinity minus seven, which is still equal to infinity. So this means your limit as x goes to infinity of x to the fourth plus x minus seven is equal to infinity. Let's wrap up by looking at an example of using the constant multiple rule. Let's get the limit as x goes to three of five multiplied by x squared. So in this case, you can use the constant multiple rule of limit as x goes to a of c multiplied by f of x is equal to c multiplied by the limit as x goes to a of f of x, which is equal to c multiplied by capital L as the result of your limit. So this allows you to move that five outside of the equation like so where you have the limit as x goes three of five multiplied by x squared is equal to five multiplied by the limit as x goes to three of x squared. Now, you could just use direct substitution to get the limit as x goes to three of x squared, which is equal to three squared, which equals nine. Now, you bring in your five to get the limit as x goes to three of five multiplied by x squared equals five multiplied by your limit result of x squared, which is nine, and this gets you a final result of 45. This should give you a solid understanding of how to calculate limits using the identity, constant, sum, difference, and constant multiple rules. Note that these examples are on the simpler side, so I recommend taking time on your own to continue practice using these properties. Calculate limits with similar examples and with more complicated ones. In the next video, you'll continue to use more limit properties to evaluate limits.

Calculate limits using properties, part 2 (8 min 59 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's continue working on more examples using limit properties. The following examples are going to be a bit more advanced than the previous video. Let's jump in with working with more rules that work with multiple functions being combined. Starting off with the product rule, let's evaluate the limit as x goes two of x multiplied by x plus one. In this case, you'll use the product rule of limit as x goes to A of F of x multiplied by G of x is equal to the limit as x goes to A of F of x multiplied by the limit as x goes to A of G of x, which is equal to their limit results of capital L multiplied by capital M. Using this with your limit, you get the limit as x goes two of x multiplied by x plus one is equal to the limit as x goes two of x multiplied by the limit as x goes two of x plus one. Let's get the limits of these two different expressions. So you have the limit as x goes two of x, which using the identity rule is just equal to two, and then you have the limit as x goes two of x plus one, which using direct substitution you get two plus one, which equals three. Now if you have capital L multiplied by capital M for your limit results, you get two multiplied by three, which equals six. This means your final result for the limit as x goes two of x multiplied by x plus one is equal to six. Let's look at another example of the product rule. This time let's say you want to get the limit as x goes one of four multiplied by x squared multiplied by x squared minus one. This is still technically two functions, even though there are two multiplication signs. Since the four is seen as a constant multiple, not as a function, you'll still use the product rule as a limit goes from x to A of F of x multiplied by G of x is equal to the limit as x goes to A of F of x multiplied by the limit as x goes to A of G of x, which is equal to their limit results, capital L multiplied by capital M as your final results. So here you have the limit as x goes to one of four multiplied by x squared multiplied by x squared minus one is equal to the limit as x goes to one of four multiplied by x squared, and then you multiply that by the limit as x goes to one of x squared minus one. Note that you can kind of put the four constant multiple wherever you want in this limit expression, you compare with the x squared, the x squared minus one, or you could move it out ahead of time from the limit is up to you. So let's get these limits where you have the limit as x goes to one of four multiplied by x squared. Using that constant multiple rule and direct substitution, you get a result of four multiplied by one squared, which equals four. Next you get the limit as x goes to one of x squared minus one, which equals one squared minus one, using direct substitution. Let's get you a result of zero. So here you have capital L multiplied by capital M for your two limit results, which equals four multiplied by zero, which equals zero. This means the limit as x goes to one of four multiplied by x squared multiplied by x squared minus one is equal to zero. So note that even though one of your limits was equal to a non-zero value, that zero value does cancel it out. Let's pivot to using a similar rule, the quotient rule. Let's get the limit as x goes two of x squared divided by x plus three, with the quotient rule, you have the limit as x goes to A of F of x divided by G of x is equal to the limit as x goes to A of F of x divided by the limit as x goes to A of G of x and this equals capital L divided by capital M for those two limit results. Remember what the quotient rule, the big theme is to make sure your denominator M is not equal to zero in order to use this rule. So this gives you the limit as x goes two of x squared divided by x plus three, which equals the limit as x goes two of x squared divided by the limit as x goes two of x plus three. Getting the limits for these two different expressions, you have the limit as x goes two of x squared equals two squared using direct substitution, which equals four, and then you have the limit as x goes two of x plus three, which equals two plus three using direct substitution, which equals five for your result. Now you'll do capital L divided by capital M for your two limit results, which is equal to four divided by five. This means your limit as x goes two of x squared divided by x plus three is equal to 4/5. Let's look at another example of the quotient rule. This time let's get the limit as x goes two infinity of 10 divided by x squared. So remember, your quotient rule, limit as x goes to A of F of x divided by G of x is equal to the limit as x goes to A of F of x divided by the limit as x goes to A of G of x, which is equal to capital L divided by capital M, for M, not equal to zero. So in this case, you'll have the limit as x goes to infinity of 10 divided by x squared is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of 10 divided by the limit as x goes to infinity of x squared. Let's get these two limit results. So you have the limit as x goes two infinity of 10, and using that constant rule, it is equal 10 even though it is going all the way to infinity because it is a constant value. Next, you get the limit as x goes to infinity of x squared, which using direct substitution you get infinity squared, which is still equal to infinity. Now you have capital L divided by capital M, which in this case equals 10 divided by infinity, which simplifies to zero. This is because the fraction result that you get is divided by an infinitely large term, making it so small that it becomes zero. So this means your final result of the limit as x goes two infinity of 10 divided by x squared is equal to zero. Let's move on to the last set of rules that function similarly to the constant multiple rule where you'll be taking out powers and roots, starting with the power rule. Let's get the limit as x goes to four of x minus one cubed. So this is a great situation to use the power rule to make it a little bit easier to solve. So here you have the limit as x goes to A of F of x to the N is equal to the limit as x goes to A of F of x and take all of that to the N, which is equal to capital L to the N. So again, you're basically taking that power out and putting it in at the very end after you get your limit result. So here you have the limit as x goes to four of x minus one cubed is equal to the limit as x goes to four of x minus one, and then you'll cube that limit result. So the limit as x goes four of x minus one is equal to four minus one using direct substitution, which gets you three. So now you can add in your power of N, which in this case is three. So you get L to the N, which equals three to the three, which equals 27. This means the limit as x goes four of x minus one cubed is equal to 27. Let's wrap up by looking at an example of using the root rule. In this case, you'll have the limit as x goes two of the square root of x cubed minus two multiplied by x. This is a great example to use the root rule, since this would be a little bit more complicated to potentially solve otherwise. So here you have the limit as x goes to A of the root N of F of x is equal to the root N of the limit as x goes to A of F of x, which is equal to the root N of capital L for your limit result. Here you get the limit as x goes to two of the square root of x cubed minus two multiplied by x, which is equal to the square root of the limit of x goes to two of x cubed minus two multiplied by x. Let's get the limit of the interior portion of the root. So you get the limit as x goes two of x cubed minus two multiplied by x. Using substitution, you get two cubed minus two multiplied by two, which is equal to eight minus four, which equals four. Next, you'll use your root rule to the root N of L, which in this case is the square root of four, which equals two. So here you have the limit as x equals two of the square root of x cube minus two multiplied by x, which equals two for your final result. Excellent job working through these limit property examples. I know it's a lot to keep track of, but practice will help reinforce these limit rules and make solving limits much quicker and easier throughout the rest of this course and in the future. In the next video, I will show you another technique for calculating limits, which we'll be exploring how to use factoring.
Calculate limits using factoring (7 min 7 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this video, you'll explore how to calculate limits Using factoring. This technique will be necessary for some polynomial and rational function limits, so it's very important to know. Let's begin by learning what factoring is. Factoring is a technique used to simplify expressions. The way it accomplishes this is by rewriting the expression to cancel out any common factors. This method is needed when you try using direct substitution, but you get an indeterminate form as the result. The goal is to use this method to change your expression into an expression you can properly calculate a limit for. So what is an indeterminate form? The following is a list of indeterminate forms you may come across. You might have zero divided by zero, zero multiplied by infinity. Infinity divided by infinity, infinity minus infinity, infinity to the zero, zero to the zero, or one to infinity. Note that zero divided by zero, infinity minus infinity, and infinity divided by infinity tend to be the most common forms you'll come across. Let's go over the steps of how to calculate limits using factoring. Step one, you will use direct substitution on an expression to identify if an indeterminate form exists and what that indeterminate form is. Step two, you'll factor the numerator and or denominator to provide common factors throughout the expression. In this case, you can use conjugates as needed. Step three, you'll replace the original expression with the factored version of the expression. Step four, you'll simplify the expression including canceling out any common factors. And step five, you'll use direct substitution to solve the simplified expression. Let's see this in action with a few examples. Let's look at the function F of X equals x squared minus four. Divide all that by X minus two. Let's get the limit as x goes to two of F of X, which is equal to the limit as x goes to two of x squared minus four divided by X minus two. Step one says that you should try and use direct substitution and see what happens. So in this case, you have two squared minus four divided by two minus two, which equals zero divided by zero. Since this is an indeterminate form, it may be a great case to use factoring to help you find the limit. Since your denominator is already simplified as much as possible, you'll want to factor your numerator and try to see if you can get at least one of its factors to match the denominator, which was X minus two. So let's factor X squared minus four, and this can factor into X minus two and x plus two. So note that when it comes to factoring, essentially the right side will then multiply through to get what you have on the left side. So you could kind of think of it as like reversing the process. Now you have the limit as X goes two of X minus two multiplied by x plus two divided by X minus two, and here you could cancel out the X minus two since they are a common factor on the top and bottom. And so now you are just getting the limit as X goes two of the expression of x plus two. Now you can use direct substitution to get your results. So you have the limit as X goes two of x plus two equals two plus two, which equals four. So this means your final result for your limit as X goes two of X squared minus four divided by X minus two is equal to four. This is a perfect example of how you went from an indeterminate form to an actual result of four for your limit. Let's look at another example where you have F of X equal to the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by X, and then outside of that square root you have minus x. This time you'll want to try and get the limit as X goes to infinity of F of X, which in this case is equal to the limit as X goes to infinity of the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by x and then minus x on the outside of that. If you use direct substitution to solve this, you get the square root of infinity squared plus four multiplied by infinity, and then outside of that you get minus infinity. This gets you an indeterminate result of infinity minus infinity, making it a great case for factoring. In this example, you'll want to use a conjugate in order to simplify your expression. So in this case, your conjugate for the expression of square root of x squared plus four multiplied by X minus x is then going to be multiplied by the conjugate divided by itself. So you have the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by X plus x and divide that by itself. Once you multiply this through, you get the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by X minus x multiplied by the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by X plus x, and then you'll divide all that by the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by x plus x. If you multiply the top together, you then get x squared plus four multiplied by x minus x squared, and then still divide that by the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by x plus x. Since the x squared cancel out on the top portion, you then get four multiplied by x divided by the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by x plus x. You can then divide X throughout all of your fraction to get four divided by the square root of one plus four divided by x plus one. Now you can use this new expression with direct substitution to get your limit. So let's get the limit as X goes to infinity of four divided by the square root of one plus four divided by x, and then plus one outside of that. So if you use this, you'll get four divided by the square root of one plus four divided by infinity plus one. In this case, your four divided by infinity will go to zero. Since the limit as X goes to infinity of one divided by X is zero due to it being such a tiny number at infinity. So this means you have four divided by the square root of one plus zero, and then plus one outside of that. This is equal to four divided by two, which is equal to two. This means your final result as the limit as x goes to infinity of the square root of x squared plus four multiplied by X minus x is equal to two. Factoring can be a bit complicated to wrap your head around at first, but it will get easier with practice. The keys are learning how to find those common factors along with understanding how to use conjugates to your advantage like you saw with the second example. Let's use this knowledge and the limit properties to learn how to calculate limits for polynomial and rational functions in the next video.

Calculate the limits of polynomial and rational functions (8 min 32 seconds)
- [Speaker] Now that you've learned how to calculate limits using their properties and factoring, let's put that together to learn how to calculate limits of some common functions. Many of these functions will use these properties that you saw in the previous few videos along with factoring, but now you can officially connect them to the functions. Let's start by exploring the limits of polynomial and rational functions. Polynomial function limits are fairly easy to work with once you're familiar with the limit rules you learned about previously. For polynomial functions, you'll usually work with the constant, constant multiple, some, difference, and power limit rules. Generally with polynomial limits, you will just use direct substitution whenever you see a polynomial function. What about when the limit goes to infinity? The rule for polynomials is the term what the highest degree determines the limit result. So if you have the limit as x goes to infinity of x squared plus x minus one, you would then look at that x squared term and infinity squared is just equal to infinity, so that would be your limit result. Let's look at an example of a polynomial limit. Let's say you have the function f of x equals four multiplied by X to the six plus three multiplied by x to the fifth, minus seven multiplied by x plus nine. Let's get the limit as x goes to two of your function four multiplied by x to the six plus three multiplied by x to the fifth minus seven multiplied by x plus nine. In this case, you can use direct substitution to just insert in that value two wherever you have x in your expression. So this gets you four multiplied by two to the six plus three multiplied by two to the fifth, minus seven multiplied by two plus nine. This gets you a final result of 347 for your limit. Let's switch over to rational limits. Rational functions in general tend to work similarly to polynomial functions where often, you just use the direct substitution method. One of the big differences though, is you need to be aware if the denominator of your rational function equals zero, since this may cause the limit to not exist. Now, what do you do if the limit goes to positive or negative infinity for rational limits? There are three main cases you should be aware of. First, if the numerator has a lower degree, then the denominator, then the limit will go to zero. When I'm talking about degree here, I'm talking about the degree of the polynomial on the top and bottom portion. So for example, if there's x squared on the top and x cubed on the bottom, then the top would have a degree of two, and the bottom would have a degree of three. And again, that would mean that the limit would go to zero. The second case is if the numerator and denominator have equal degrees, then the limit will be the ratio of the leading coefficients. So let's say you had two multiplied by x cubed, divided by five, multiplied by x cubed. In this case, then the limit would just be two divided by five. Third case is if the numerator has a higher degree than the denominator, then the limit will go to positive or negative infinity depending on the signs of the coefficients. So let's say you have x cubed divided by x squared. So in this case, the numerator would have the higher degree than the denominator. You would then have it go to positive infinity for your limit result. Let's take a look at an example of getting a rational limit. So let's say you have f of x equals three multiplied by x squared plus five divided by x minus two. Let's get the limit as x goes to three. So you have three multiplied by x squared plus five divided by x minus two. And let's substitute that value three and wherever you have your x, so here you have three multiplied by three squared plus five divided by three minus two. This simplifies to 27 plus five divided by one, which equals 32 for your final limit result. Now, what do you do in the case where you want to get a limit of a rational function such as f of x equals four multiplied by x squared minus six, multiplied by x minus 18 divided by x squared minus nine, and you come across one of those indeterminate forms I mentioned prior. This is where you can then use factoring like you learned in the previous video. So if you look at this particular example where you have, let's say the limit as x goes to three of four multiplied by x squared minus six multiplied by x minus 18, divide all that by x squared minus nine, and you plug in that value three where you have x, you get four multiplied by three squared minus six multiplied by three minus 18 divided by three squared minus nine, which is equal to zero divided by zero. So this is a great case where you can then simplify this limit expression using factoring by rewriting and canceling out any common factors in order to get your limit. So let's factor out your rational expression four multiplied by x squared minus six, multiplied by X minus 18 divided by x squared minus nine. In this case, you can factor out the denominator of x squared minus nine to simply be x minus three multiplied by x plus three. You can start with a denominator in this case since it's a little bit more straightforward factor, and it can help give you an idea of how to factor the numerator in order to find a common factor to cancel out. Now, let's factor the numerator. First, you'll adjust your numerator expression a little bit to be four multiplied by x squared minus six multiplied by X minus 18 to transform it to be four multiplied by x squared minus 12 multiplied by x plus six multiplied by x minus 18. Note that the right side is equal to the left side. It's just now you have minus 12 plus six for x instead of just minus six. Since this will allow you to factor and get the common factor that we are looking for. Let's separate out two different portions of your equation. So let's look at the first two terms, four multiplied by x squared minus 12 multiplied by x, which in this case, you can factor that to be four multiplied by x and then x minus three. And then the second two terms, you have six multiplied by x minus 18, which you can factor that to be six multiplied by x minus three. So if you put this together, you have four multiplied by x squared minus six multiplied by x minus 18 equals six, multiplied by x minus three, multiplied by four, multiplied by x, multiplied by X minus three. You can then combine this to be four multiplied by x plus six, and then multiply that by x minus three. This will make it easier when it comes to simplifying your rational function. So now it's finally factored out from four multiplied by x squared minus six, multiplied by x minus 18 divided by x minus nine, which is equal to four multiplied by x plus six multiplied by x minus three. Divide that by x minus three, multiplied by x plus three. You can then cancel out your common factor of x minus three to get you a new result of four multiplied by x plus six divided by x plus three four year function. So let's get the limit as x goes to three a four multiplied by x plus six divided by x plus three. Using direct substitution, you get four multiplied by three plus six divided by three plus three. This equals 12 plus six divided by six, which equals three. This means your finite limit result as x goes to three of four multiplied by x squared minus six, multiplied by x minus 18 divided by x squared minus nine is equal to three. The limits for these types of functions tend to be straightforward once you know how to use dark substitution, the limit rules, and factoring when it comes to rational functions, the main difficult portion is when you're using that factoring with the rational functions, and sometimes they're not quite as straightforward. I recommend taking time on your own to continue practicing getting limits of polynomial and rational functions. In the next video, I will show you how to work with exponential and logarithmic limits.

Calculate the limits of exponential and logarithmic functions (5 min 22 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's continue learning how to calculate limits for some of the common types of functions. In general, you can use direct substitution, like you did with polynomial functions, when it comes to gathering the limits for exponential and logarithmic functions. In this video, I will focus on reviewing limit results for certain scenarios, along with exploring the general behaviors for these two types of functions and their limits. Let's first explore their general behavior. Exponential functions with a base greater than zero tend to grow or decay depending on the exponent sign that they have. This shows up in their limits. Logarithmic functions where the base is greater than one grow slowly in our undefined, where X is less than or equal to zero. Again, this also shows in their limits. Let's review some common exponential limits. Starting with your general exponential functions of A to the X, you have the limit as X goes to infinity of A to the X is equal to infinity if A is greater than one. If you have the limit as X goes to negative infinity of A to the X, this is equal to zero if A is greater than one. If you get the limit as X goes to infinity of A to the X, this will equal zero if A is between zero and one. And finally, if the limit as X goes to negative infinity of A to the X is equal to infinity, if A is between zero and one. Next, you have the limit as X goes to infinity of A to the X is equal to infinity. Then the limit as X goes to negative infinity of A to the X is equal to zero. Now, let's flip those exponent signs so you get the limit as X goes to infinity of A to the negative X is equal to zero, and then the limit as X goes to negative infinity of A to the negative X is equal to infinity. Now, let's look at a few other specific scenarios for exponential limits, so you have the limit as X goes to zero of one plus X to the one divided by X is equal to E. And finally, the limit as X goes to zero of A to the X minus one divided by X is equal to one. When it comes to limits for logarithms, including natural ones, if X goes to infinity, then the limit will also go to infinity. If X is going to zero from the right, then the limit will equal negative infinity. Remember, logarithms are not defined for X less than or equal to zero, so with logarithmic limits, you will only be looking at the ones that are above zero. Let's look at a few simple examples. Let's start off by getting an exponential limit, where you have F of X equals two to the X plus five. Here you get the limit as X goes to negative infinity of two to the X plus five. In this case, you could separate this out using the sum rule, so you have the limit as X goes to negative infinity of two to the X, which, using the limit you saw prior, is equal to zero, and then the limit as X goes to negative infinity of five is equal to five using the constant rule. This means the limit as X goes negative infinity of two to the X plus five is equal to zero plus five, which equals just five. Next, let's look at a limit of a logarithmic function. Let's look at the function F of X equals the natural log of X, subtracted by the natural log of X plus one. In this case, let's get the limit as X goes to infinity of the natural log of X, subtracted by the natural log of X plus one. If you use logarithmic properties, you can actually change the limit as X goes to infinity of the natural log of X minus the natural log of X plus one to have them be divided. So here, you have the limit as X goes to infinity of the natural log of X divided by X plus one. One trick you could do here is dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same term in order to simplify it. In this case, you have X divided by X plus one, and let's divide both of these terms by X. So this gets you X divided by X, and then you'll divide that by X plus one divided by X. If you simplify this, you get one divided by one plus one divided by X. Let's plug this into your limit, so you have the limit as X goes to infinity of the natural log of one divided by one plus one divided by X is equal to the natural log of one divided by one plus one divided by infinity using direct substitution. One divided by infinity goes to zero, so you have the result of natural log of one divided by one plus zero, which equals the natural log of one, which equals zero. So this means the limit as X goes to infinity of the natural log of X minus the natural log of X plus one is equal to zero. The limits for these types of functions are incredibly useful to know, and it's good to know the few tricks I showed you and their common tendencies and properties I showed in this video. I recommend taking time to memorize and understand the special scenarios for exponential and logarithmic functions. Let's pivot and look how to solve use in limits using another method called the Squeeze Theorem.

Calculate limits using the squeeze theorem (7 min 41 seconds)
- [Instructor] So far, you have learned about how to use a variety of techniques to calculate limits, such as using direct substitution, limit rules and factoring. What do you do though, if these methods don't work? This is when the Squeeze Theorem becomes useful. The Squeeze Theorem allows you to calculate the limit of a function by squeezing it between two other functions, hence the name, "Squeeze Theorem". The way it works is the two other functions have to have their limits equal to each other at the point being evaluated. This theorem is sometimes called the Sandwich Theorem, or Pinching Theorem. Let's look at a technical definition of this theorem. Let F of X, G of X, and H of X all be functions over an open interval between A and B. If F of X is less than or equal to G of X, which is less than or equal to H of X, and for A, less than or equal to C, less than or equal to B, such that the limit as X goes to C of F of X equals the limit as X goes to C of H of X, which equals the capital limit L, then you have the limit as X goes C of G of X is equal to that same limit result, L. This allows you to use the limit result from one of the other functions that are easier to calculate in order to get the limit of the more difficult function you are working with. So why is the Squeeze Theorem needed in the first place? The Squeeze Theorem can be proven very useful to calculate limits for situations where typical analytical techniques don't work, such as direct substitution. It is also helpful when taking limits of trigonometric functions, or when dealing with oscillatory terms. So how do you calculate a limit using the Squeeze Theorem? The steps to use the theorem are, step one, first, try solving the expression using a method such as direct substitution. If it can't be solved, then you can try using the Squeeze Theorem. Step two, bound the expression with an inequality. Step three, modify the inequality to gather the full function using algebra throughout the whole inequality. This may include adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing. Just make sure you do it through all three parts of the inequality. Step four, evaluate the left and right hand limits, which are found on the outside of your inequality. And finally, step five, apply the Squeeze Theorem if the limits equal each other in order to get your overall limit of the function you are looking at. This theorem can be a bit confusing at first to understand, so let's review a few examples on how to use this. Let's look at the limit as X goes to zero of X squared, multiplied by E, to the negative one divided by x squared. If you use direct substitution for this, you get the limit as X goes to zero of X squared, multiplied by E, to the negative one divided by X squared. This equals zero squared multiplied by E to the negative one divided by zero squared. Since you can't divide by zero, this is a great scenario when you could potentially use the Squeeze Theorem. Now that you've tried solving it but can't, you can now bound your expression, which in this case makes sense to focus on the term, E to the negative one divided by X squared, since that is the one that is giving you issues. Now, the lowest this expression can go is zero, and the highest it can go is one. So this gives you the inequality of zero, less than or equal to E to the negative one divided by X squared, which is less than or equal to one. Now let's modify this inequality to get your full function. So to do this, you need to multiply X squared throughout this inequality. So here, you have X squared multiplied by zero, is less than or equal to X squared multiplied by E to the negative one, divided by X squared, which is less than or equal to X squared multiplied by one. If you simplify this, you have left side just equal to zero, and you'll have less than or equal to X squared, multiplied by E to the negative one divided by X squared, which is the function you were originally trying to get the limit for. And then finally, the right side is less than or equal to just X squared. Let's evaluate the left and right hand limits as X goes to zero. So, as the limit as X goes to zero for zero, is just equal to zero since it is a constant term. Next, for the limit as X goes to zero of X squared, using direct substitution, you get zero squared, which equals zero. Since the limit as X goes to zero of zero is equal to the limit as X goes to zero of X squared, meaning zero equals zero, that means that you can apply the Squeeze Theorem. This is because the left and right hand limits equal each other, and so you can then use this as your final limit result. So you have the limit as X goes to zero of X squared multiplied by E to the negative one, divided by X squared is equal to zero. Let's look at another example where you can get a taste of using this, but this time with trigonometric functions. Let's get the limit as X goes to infinity of sine of one divided by X, and divide all that by X. Let's get the limit as X goes to infinity of sine of one divided by X, divided by X, using direct substitution. If you use this, you get the sine of one divided by infinity, divided by infinity. Since the sine function has oscillating behavior as X goes to infinity, this is a great scenario to use the Squeeze Theorem. Let's bound this expression in an inequality, and it makes sense to focus on the sine of one divided by X term, since this seems to be the one giving us the most problems at the moment. Now the lowest sine of X can go is negative one, and the highest it can go is one. You can apply the same to this expression as long as X does not equal zero. This is because it will oscillate between these two values. This gives you an inequality of negative one is less than or equal to sine of one divided by X, which is less than or equal to one. Now let's modify the inequality to get your full expression. So you have one divided by X, multiplied by negative one is less than or equal to one divided by X, multiplied by sine of one divided by X, and that is less than or equal to one divided by X, multiplied by one. Simplify this to get negative one divided by X is less than or equal to one divided by X, multiplied by sine of one divided by x, which is less than or equal to one divided by X. Let's evaluate your left and right hand limits as X goes to infinity. So the limit as X goes to infinity of negative one divided by X is equal to negative one divided by infinity, which goes to zero because it ends up being such a small number. Next, let's get the limit as X goes to infinity of one divided by X, which equals one divided by infinity, which also goes to zero since again, it is such a small number at that point. This means your limit as X goes to infinity of negative one divided by X is equal to the limit as X goes to infinity of one divided by X, meaning zero equals zero. So this means your final result of the limit as X goes to infinity of sine of one divided by X, divided by X, is equal to zero. This theorem can be a bit tricky to get used to at first, but as you saw with a few examples, it can be incredibly useful. I suggest taking time on your own to continue practice using this theorem. In the next video, you'll see this theorem in action as you learn how to calculate limits of common trigonometric functions.

Calculate the limits of trigonometric functions (4 min 28 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up learning how to calculate limits of common function types by exploring trigonometric function limits. In general, you can use direct substitution like you did with the previous functions when it comes to trigonometric functions. The main concepts I will review are the limit results for certain scenarios along with how to use the squeeze theorem to find limits of trigonometric functions. The limit for all six trigonometric functions as X goes to A can be evaluated at the constant A by simply plugging it into the function. For example, let's say you have the limit as X goes to A of the trigonometric function sine of X. You can simply plug in the value of A to get a result of sine of A. The limit for all six trigonometric functions evaluated for a limit as X goes to positive or negative infinity is not defined. So again, we say it's undefined. This is due to oscillating behavior for the functions causing them to never settle on one value. Let's take a look at a few limit examples. Starting off with an easy one, let's say you want to get the limit as X goes to pi divided by four for the function tangent of X. You can simply plug in the value pi over four to get tangent pi over four, which is equal to one. Super easy. Let's look at a squeeze theorem example. Let's get the limit as X goes to zero for the function X squared multiplied by cosine of one divided by X. If you use direct substitution, this method will provide an undefined result because you have the limit as X goes to zero of x squared multiplied by the cosine of one divided by X, and if you put in zero squared multiplied by cosine of one divided by zero, it's undefined since you cannot divide by zero. This is a great scenario to use the squeeze theorem. Let's first bound the part of the expression that is causing us issues, which in this case it would make sense to focus on the cosine of one divided by X since that is what is giving us issues with it being divided by zero if you use that substitution method. Now, you should know that the lowest value that cosine of X can go to is negative one, and the highest value this can go to is one. You can then apply the same fact to cosine of one divided by X. So you'll have negative one, less than or equal to cosine of one divided by X is less than or equal to one, where you have X not equal to zero. With this inequality, you can now start to use that squeeze theorem. Let's modify the inequality you found to get the full function. So in this case, you'll want to multiply X squared through the whole inequality. So this gets you X squared multiplied by negative one, which is less than or equal to X squared, multiplied by cosine of one divided by X, which is less than or equal to X squared, multiplied by one. Once you simplify this a little bit, you get negative X squared is less than or equal to X squared multiplied by cosine of one divided by X, which is less than or equal to X squared. Let's evaluate the left and right-hand limits of this inequality as X goes to zero. So you'll be getting the limits as X goes to zero for negative X squared and as X goes to zero for X squared. So, the limit as X goes to zero for negative X squared, you can use direct substitution to get negative zero squared, which is zero. Then, the limit of X going to zero for X squared is equal to zero squared, which is also equal to zero. This means your limit as X goes to zero for negative x squared is equal to the limit as X goes to zero for X squared, meaning they both equal zero. Since these limits equal each other, then you can use the squeeze theorem to conclude the limit as X goes to zero for your full function X squared multiplied by the cosine of one divided by X is equal to zero. The limits for trigonometric functions tend to be fairly straightforward to work with. When you have scenarios that are more difficult than just using direct substitution, that's when the squeeze theorem can become useful. Let's wrap up this chapter by discussing when limits fail to exist.

When limits fail to exist (5 min 33 seconds)
- [Instructor] Time to wrap up this chapter and topic of limits. So far, I have discussed a variety of scenarios and methods to calculate limits, but what happens when you are unable to calculate a limit and get a valid answer? There are a variety of scenarios where you try to calculate limits but are unable to do so. These scenarios are when you say the limit does not exist or it is sometimes shortened to DNE. What this means is that there's no solution for the limit. What about when the limit equals positive or negative infinity? In previous examples you saw that sometimes limits equal positive or negative infinity, but are these truly valid limit solutions? Well, you can declare a limit equals positive or negative infinity and find use in interpreting that limit. Note that the limit technically does not exist since the result is not a real number. Let's review some of the common scenarios for when limits don't exist. Some of these scenarios you may have come across so far in these chapters. I'll explain each scenario and provide a quick example to solidify the reasoning behind it. The first scenario is when the left and right limits don't match. This was mentioned earlier when discussing one-sided limits. This is incredibly common when working with piecewise functions. For example, let's say you have the limit as X goes to zero, for the function, the absolute value of X divided by X. If you get the limit as X approaches the right, so the limit of X, the zero plus of the absolute value of X divided by X. This equals one. If you get the limit as X approaches from the left, you get the limit of X approaches zero minus is absolute value of X divided by X is equal to negative one. This means your right and left limits do not equal each other because one does not equal negative one in this case. So then you will state the limit as X goes to zero of absolute value of X divided by X is equal to DNE, as in the limit does not exist. The second scenario is when there is unbounded behavior. Like I mentioned earlier, this is when your limits are equal to positive or negative infinity. This type of scenario can indicate there might be a vertical asymptote in your function. For example, if you try and get the limit as X goes to zero of one divided by X squared, this is equal to positive infinity. This is because this function proceeds to get infinitely large the smaller and closer it gets to zero. Because the limit is infinity though, this technically means that the limit does not exist, so you could write it as the limit as X goes to zero of one divided by X squared equals DNE. The next scenario is oscillating behavior. This is when the function infinitely oscillates as it approaches a point. The point being approached can be positive or negative infinity in this scenario. Since the limit will not settle on one value, this will cause the limit to not exist, because again, there is no certain value that you could say it stays at. The most common example for this is trigonometric functions such as sine of X approaching infinity. Since this function oscillates between the values of negative one to one. So here if you take the limit as X goes to infinity of sine of X, and again, you know that sine of X goes between negative one and one, then you would say the limit as X approaches infinity for sine of x equals DNE, as in it does not exist. Another scenario is when the function is not defined at the point where you are trying to take the limit. Since the function is not defined at that point, then you'll be unable to get a limit at that point. For example, let's say you want to get the limit as X goes to negative two of the square root of X. Since you're unable to take the square root of negative numbers and get a real number result, the limit of this function does not exist, so you would put DNE. The final scenario is where part of a limit may not exist by these standards such as sine of X, but when you combine it with a function such as sine of X divided by X, then you can find the limit using a method like the squeeze theorem. If you are unable to do that though, then sometimes the limit will just still not exist, so again, you would say the limit does not exist. As you continue evaluating limits, you will come across scenarios where the limit does not exist. It is good to understand how to discern when a limit does not exist, why it does not exist, and what this might indicate such as a vertical asymptote. Also be aware there are sometimes cases where the limits may appear to not exist, but might actually be possible to calculate using methods such as the squeeze theorem. This wraps up learning how to evaluate limits. I showed you a variety of methods and scenarios to ensure you have a solid foundation since limits are so important for calculus. Remember, practice is what will help you continue to solidify the knowledge you are learning throughout this course. In the next chapter, you will explore the concept of continuity, which will heavily use limits throughout that chapter.

Continuity
What is continuity? (3 min 21 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you will explore the topic of continuity. Continuity is an important concept to know in order to better understand how limits work with functions, and later on, how to work with derivatives and integrals. Let's start off with understanding exactly what continuity is. Continuity is when you determine if a mathematical function is continuous or discontinuous. The easiest way to visualize this is imagine you are drawing a graph of a function with a pen on a piece of paper. If the pen never lifts as you are drawing, then the function is continuous. If the pen does lift at some point while you are drawing, then the function is discontinuous. Speaking of visualizing, let's take a look at a few examples of graphs of functions that are continuous and discontinuous. The function to the left, that is in blue, is a continuous function, since there are no obvious breaks in the function, and it is one smooth curve. The function that is in red is discontinuous because you'll notice it starts off with kind of a parabola function, and then there's a jump down at the value of x equals two to a different part of the function, and so you'll notice that the line is not fully connected. So again, if you had your pen, you would have to then lift it and then put it back down on the paper at x equals two in order to continue drawing the curve. So why is continuity so important? Knowing if a function is continuous will allow you to perform certain operations on the function at certain points or intervals. This includes being able to do derivatives. Continuity is also crucial for certain mathematical theorems to work such as the intermediate value theorem. Speaking of points and intervals, in the following two videos, you'll explore the definitions for having continuity at a point versus continuity on an interval. This is because there are some functions that only have continuity at certain points or within certain intervals. This is different than other functions that are continuous over their entire domain. As far as functions that are continuous over their entire domains, these include polynomial functions, rational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions. This also includes inverse functions, but note that their original functions must be continuous and one-to-one, meaning each value in the domain matches a unique value in the range. You may notice this includes the majority of functions that you have explored so far in this course. This is because continuous functions tend to be the most relevant ones to work with when it comes to calculus. In summary, you have learned that continuity is how you measure whether a function is continuous or discontinuous. Over the following videos, you will expand upon this topic and dive into further detail with more specific definitions and examples. Let's start with exploring continuity at a point.

Continuity at a point (5 min 47 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's start off by exploring continuity at a point. This means you are looking to see if a function is continuous at a particular point, such as 0 or 20. Note that this will only be checking for a point in particular, and it does not mean that the function is automatically continuous at all points in its domain. Let's jump into a formal definition. A function f is continuous at a point x equals a where the three following conditions are met: First, the function f must be defined at x equals a. Second, the function must have a limit that exists as x approaches a. And third, the limit as x approaches a must have f of x equals f of a. To expand upon the last condition, note that the limit as x approaches a must work for the left limit, right limit, and the overall limit. If this is not the case, then the function is discontinuous at the point x equals a. Let's look at this in a few examples. Let's begin with a simple example where f of x equals x^3. Let's say you want to determine if this function is continuous at the point x equals 1. Let's first see if the function f of x equals x^3 is defined at x equals 1. You can do this by plugging the value in, so f of 1 equals 1^3, which equals 1. Since this checks out, you're ready to check the next condition. Since this checks out, you're ready to move to the next condition to check to calculate the limit for this function. Let's calculate the limit for your function. So you'll have the limit as x goes to 1 for x^3. In order to calculate the limit for x^3, you can substitute 1 into the function to find the limit. This gets you 1^3, which simplifies to just be 1. This proves that the limit does exist. Now, let's check for the third condition to see if f of x equals f of a, which in this case, from when you plugged it into the function versus when you plugged it into the limit, you do have f of x equals f of a, where in this case it has 1 equal to 1. Since all three conditions are met, you could state the function f of x equals x^3 is continuous at the point of x equals 1. In this particular case, you can note that x^3 is defined for the whole function, but it is good to see the process of how to do this. Let's take a look at another example. Let's say you have the function f of x equals x^2 minus x plus 6, dividing all of that by x minus 3. Let's see if this function is continuous at x equals 3. You'll begin by seeing if the function is defined at the point x equals 3. You could do this by plugging it into your function. So f of 3 equals 3^2 minus 3 plus 6, divided by 3 minus 3. This gets you a result of 12 divided by 0, which is unfortunately undefined because you cannot divide by 0. Since the function is not defined at f of a, then it is not continuous at the point x equals 3. Let's look at one more example, where this time, you have a function f of x equal to x, where x is less than 5, and x plus 2, where x is greater than or equal to 5. Like before, let's begin by seeing if the function is defined at the point x equals 5. You could do this by plugging it into your function, where f of 5 will equal 5 plus 2. Because you're working with the value 5, you'll be working with the second portion of the function x plus 2. This gets you a value of 7, meaning it is defined. Now, let's move on to the second condition. In this case, you'll need to calculate the left and right limits in order to get the limit for the function f of x. This is due to the way it is defined and the particular point you're working with. Let's begin by getting the left limit, so the limit as x approaches 5 from the left of x is equal 5. If you substitute in your value, which equals just 5. Now, looking at the right limit of the limit of x going to 5 from the right of x plus 2 equals 5 plus 2, which equals 7. So in this case, the left limit of your function limit as x goes to 5 from the left of f of x is not equal to the right limit, which is the limit as x goes to 5 from the right of f of x. This is because your values 5 and 7 do not equal each other. This is a case where you would state the limit as x goes to 5 of f of x equals DNE, which means it does not exist. Since this did not meet your second condition, you'll state that your function f of x is not continuous at the point x equals 5. So why is continuity at just one little point so important. As you saw, continuity at a point can be the difference between being able to calculate a limit or not at a certain point in a function. The same will go for when you calculate derivatives later on in this course. Finding continuity at a point is a simple concept, but it has a huge significance in order to perform many of the calculations throughout this course, including the limits you calculated earlier on. Next step, let's explore continuity on an interval.

Continuity on an interval (6 min 58 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now that you've learned about continuity at a point, let's expand upon this topic to learn about continuity on an interval. Continuity on an interval can be a bit more complex, so let's start with looking at the big picture. Let's bring back that graph drawing analogy. In this case, you'll imagine drawing the graph of a function with a pen on a piece of paper from start to finish, which will be from point A to point B. If you do not have to lift your pen from the paper at any point, then the function is continuous. If the pen is lifted from the paper at some point, then the function is discontinuous. Before I go into a formal definition of continuity on an interval, let's first take a moment to define continuity from the left and from the right. First, function f of x is continuous from the right at a point a if the limit as x goes to a and notated the plus sign for it being from the right of f of x equals f of a. Second, a function f of x is continuous from the left point a if the limit as x goes to a with a minus sign notating that it's going from the left of f of x equals f of a. Now let's look at a formal definition of continuity on an interval. A function f of x is continuous on an interval if it is continuous for every point in that interval. As you could tell, this continuity is derived from the previous continuity you learned at a point. It logically makes sense that you would want all the points defined within the interval you have in order to have it be continuous throughout the whole interval. Let's define this further for open and closed intervals. An open interval is defined as parentheses a to b for points a and b and this particular interval does not include its endpoints. A closed interval is defined as hard brackets a and b for points a and b where this interval does include its endpoint a and b. For example, you would have an open interval of parentheses five comma 10. This would not include your values of five and 10 in your interval. Next, looking at a closed interval, you have hard brackets five and 10. This will include your values of five and 10 within your interval. Now, let's take a look at continuity on open versus closed intervals. A function f of x is continuous on an open interval a and b if it is continuous for every point on that interval, hence it being the same as the regular definition of continuity on an interval. Next, a function f of x is continuous on a closed interval hard brackets a and b if it is continuous for every point on the interval, continuous from the right of a, and continuous from the left of b. You could do this by taking the right limit of a and the left limit of b and ensure they equal f of a and f of b respectively. Now you see the extra requirements to ensure the endpoints are properly defined for the closed interval version of this definition of continuity. Let's take a look at this in a few examples. Let's begin with a simple example of f of x equals x squared on the open interval of zero to three. Note that this is an open interval due to the parentheses used around it instead of the hard brackets. In order to determine if this is continuous on this interval, you would use the definition of continuity at a point for every single point on the interval. In this case, since you know the function f of x equals x squared is a polynomial function and polynomial functions are continuous for all real numbers, then you can determine that f of x equals x squared is continuous on the open interval zero to three. Let's expand upon the first example for f of x equals x squared, but this time let's do it for the closed interval of hard brackets zero to three. You already know it is continuous for the open interval zero to three as you saw in the previous example, but now you need to determine if it is continuous from the right of a and continuous from the left of b. You could do this by taking the right limit of a and the left limit of b. In order to ensure these bounds equal the values of the function, let's first calculate those function values. So for your first value of zero, you'll plug it in to get f of zero equals zero squared, which equals zero. For your other bound three, you can plug it in to get f of three equals three squared, which equals nine. Now, let's get your limits for the left and right. So getting the limit as x approaches zero from the right of x squared. In this case, you could just plug in the value to get zero squared, which equals zero. Next, the limit as x approaches three from the left of x squared, you can also plug this in to just get three squared, which equals nine. Since both of these limit results equal their function values accordingly, you can then state your function f of x equals x squared is continuous on the closed interval of zero to three. So why is continuity over an open or closed interval important in the first place? As you saw earlier, continuity at a point can be the difference between being able to calculate a limit or a derivative at a certain point in a function or not. Being able to do so on the interval of a function, especially the full interval, allows you to fully define functions as continuous and perform calculations on more than just one point at a time. In the bigger picture, having continuity at a point or an interval allows you to work with optimization problems, numerical approximations, and numerical methods in mathematics. In a practical aspect, it allows engineers and physicists to properly model natural phenomena, such as temperature, speed, and growth. Finding continuity over an interval will help you perform many of the calculations throughout this course along with help you better understand and define many of the continuous functions such, as polynomials. Now, let's take a moment to dive deeper into discontinuity and what it really means.

What is discontinuity? (8 min 1 seconds)
- [Instructor] Over the last few videos, you've heard the word discontinuous mentioned multiple times. In this video, you will focus on understanding exactly what that means. Discontinuity is when you have a function that is not continuous. Hence, when you are drawing that graph with your pen and paper, at some point when you are drawing it, the pen lifts from the paper. This causes the function to be discontinuous. As you have seen prior, there are many instances that will disqualify a function from being continuous, hence, making it discontinuous. A function is discontinuous if any of the following are true: first, if the function f of x is not defined at a point, such as f of a not being defined, next, if the limit of f of x does not exist. Another reason is if the limit of f of x does not equal f of a. And finally, if the right or left limits of f of x don't exist or don't equal each other. There are three main types of discontinuities you will come across. This includes: removable discontinuities, jump discontinuities, and infinite discontinuities. Note that these are the three main types you will explore in this course, but some discontinuities do not fit in these definitions. Let's look at these in more detail by starting with removable discontinuities. A removable discontinuity is when you have a hole in the graph of a function. This occurs when the limit at a for a function f of x exists, but the function is not defined at f of a. This graph shows you a removable discontinuity where you have a hole in it. So here you have a blue line, and then at the point of x equals one and y equals two, you'll see you have an open circle. This is often how a removable discontinuity is noted, where that function is not defined at that particular point. A jump discontinuity is when sections of your function do not properly meet in a finite manner. This means there will be a jump when you graph the function. This occurs when the left and right limits exist, but they do not equal each other, hence, creating the jump in the function. This is a graph of a jump discontinuity. So at the point x equals two, you'll see the blue line is going up towards y equals three, and then all of a sudden, it jumps down to y equals negative one. Hence why you see it is given the name jump discontinuity because it's like you are jumping from the top part of the function to the bottom part at that particular point. An infinite discontinuity is when sections of your function do not properly meet in an infinite manner. This means your function is usually divided by a vertical asymptote. This occurs when the left limit and/or right limits equal negative or positive infinity. This graph shows you an infinite discontinuity. So you'll see your function has two different lines where it starts from the left, and then suddenly goes down at x equals three. And then on the right side, you'll see it is really high at x equals three and quickly goes back down. So this is not a jump discontinuity because you cannot see finite points where you are jumping from one part of the function to the next part of the function at the same point. Instead, you have what is called the vertical asymptote at the x equals three mark, where it is essentially dividing the function, and each part of it is going up and down simultaneously to positive and negative infinity. Let's look at a few examples of discontinuities. For example one, let's look at the function f of x equals x squared minus x plus six divided by x minus three. And let's look at the discontinuity at the point x equals three. As you calculated before, your function is not defined at x equals three due to it being divided by zero when you have three minus three. Let's take the limit of the function to determine what type of discontinuity this is. If you take the limit as x approaches three of x squared minus x plus six divided by x minus three, you'll then get the limit as x approaches three of x minus three multiplied by x plus two by factoring the top part, and then divide by x minus three. Now, you can take out your x minus three on both parts to get limit as x approaches three of x plus two is equal to three plus two by substituting the value three in, and that equals five. So in this case, the function is not defined at x equals three, but its limit exists. This means you have a removable discontinuity. Let's look at another example. Let's say you have the function f of x equals x for values of x less than five, and for x plus two for values of x greater than or equal to five. And let's look at the point x equals five to understand the discontinuity here. Let's begin by taking the limit of your function as x approaches five. So in this case, since the value is five, you'll be using the part of the function that is x plus two. So you'll get the limit as x approaches five of x plus two, which equals five plus two, which equals seven. Now let's take a look at the right and left limits. With the right limit, you get the limit as x approaches five from the right of x plus two equals five plus two, which equals seven. Now let's look at the left limit. With this limit, you get the limit as x approaches five from the left of x, since you are now looking at values less than five, coming from the left direction. This then equals five. In this case, your left limits and right limits do not equal each other. This is then labeled a jump discontinuity due to the jump between the two sections of the function. Let's look at one last example where this time you'll look at the function f of x equals x plus five divided by x plus one. And let's look at the discontinuity of x equals negative one. Like before, if you plug in the value of negative one, you get negative one plus five divided by negative one plus one equals four divided by zero. Since it is divided by zero, this means that it is not defined at that particular point. So let's get some limits to determine what is going on here. Let's focus on the right and left limits. So starting with the right limit, you get the limit as x approaches negative one from the right of x plus five divided by x plus one is equal to infinity. And then if you look at the left limit, you have the limit as x approaches negative one from the left of x plus five divided by x plus one equals negative infinity. In this case, both the left and right limits are either negative or positive infinity, making this an infinite discontinuity. So why is discontinuity important? Discontinuity can be an indication of where a function is behaving abnormally or has a sudden shift, affecting how it can be used within calculations. In the real world, discontinuity can point to sudden changes in velocity, temperature, or stock prices. Understanding discontinuity is important to know not only how it will affect potential calculations you can perform, but also provide you a better understanding of the function you are working with. Let's expand upon continuity in the next two videos by exploring some theorems starting with the composite function theorem.

Composite function theorem (5 min 33 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the next two videos, you'll explore two theorems that work due to the help of continuity. Let's start off with one theorem that can help you calculate limits, the composite function theorem. Before I jump into this theorem though, let's first review what a composite function is. A composite function is created when you combine two or more functions where the output of one function is used as the input of another function. This can be simplified to just a function within another function. It is often denoted as the functions of f of x and g of x that form a composite function of f of g of x or g of f of x. You may have noticed you've already been working with composite functions a little bit throughout the course, but now you can officially put a name to it and fully understand it. Now, let's move on to the theorem. The composite function theorem states if a function f of x is continuous at x equals b and the limit as x goes to a of g of x equals b, then the limit as x goes to a of f of g of x is equal to f of the limit as x goes to a of g of x, which at the end is just equal to f of b. Essentially, this is stating that you can take the limit of a composite function by taking the limit of the inner function then applying the outer function to the result of the limit of the inner function. Why is the composite function theorem important in the first place? First, this theorem is helpful to simplify and speed up the process when performing calculations that contain composite functions. In particular, this theorem is incredibly useful when proving that trigonometric functions are continuous over their domains. Let's use this theorem with a few examples. Let's say, you have the composite function f of g of x equals e to the cosine of x. Note that these types of functions will often just be denoted as f of x, but in this case I want to make it very obvious that it is a composite function, so we can label the outer and inner functions accordingly. Let's say, you want to get the limit as x goes to 0 of your composite function f of g of x. This means you want to get the limit as x goes to 0 of e to the cosine of x. Since this would be a little bit tricky to do, you can then break it down into your two functions. So, in this case, your outer function is f of x equal to e of x, since that is the outermost function you're working with. Next is the inner function, which in this case is actually in the exponent of your outer function. So, this means that g of x equals cosine of x. Now, using the composite function theorem, let's get the limit of g of x, which is your inner function. So, the limit as x goes to 0 of cosine of x equals cosine of 0, which equals 1. Now, let's use that theorem to then apply the outer function f of x with the result of your limit of g of x. So, getting the function f with your limit as x approaches 0 of g of x in this case equals e to the one which simplifies to just e. Now, the theorem comes together to give you a final result of the limit as x approaches 0 of e to the cosine of x equals e. Let's look at another example. This time, let's look at the composite function, f of g of x equals sin of x squared. Let's get the limit as x approaches 0 of f of g of x, which equals the limit as x approaches 0 of sin of x squared for this problem. Let's gather your outer and inner functions. In this case, your outer function is your trigonometric function sin of x, so f of x equals sin of x. And then your inner function is what's inside of your sin function. So, this means g of x equals x squared. Now, use your composite function theorem to start by getting the limit of your inner function, so you have the limit as x approaches 0 of x squared equals 0 squared, which is equal to just 0. Now, let's apply the outer function f to this to get f of the limit as x approaches 0 of g of x equals sin of 0, which is just 0. Bringing this theorem together gets you a final result of the limit as x approaches 0 of sin of x squared equals 0. The composite function theorem is used in many practical applications. In economics, it is used to analyze how variables such as interest rates affect other variables like consumer spending. In biology, it is used in population growth rates calculations where it has to factor in variables such as food availability. In physics, it is used to calculate the velocity of an object undergoing accelerated motion. This will not be the last time you see composite functions, since they will be common throughout calculus and hence throughout the rest of the course. Knowing this theorem is incredibly helpful when calculating more complicated limits. Next, let's explore another theorem that works closely with continuity, the intermediate value theorem.

Intermediate value theorem (4 min 45 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up this chapter with another theorem. In this video, I will show you the Intermediate Value Theorem and how to use it. Let's get started. The Intermediate Value Theorem states if a function f of x is continuous over a closed-bounded interval a to b and d is any number between f of a and f of b, then there exists a number c such that a less than c less than b and f of c equals d. Note that this theorem is sometimes shortened to just IVT. Let's look at this graphically to see the Intermediate Value Theorem in action. Let's look at the graph of this function, represented by the blue line, and this is a continuous function on this graph. Let's look at the values of x equals negative 2 and x equals 0. Since this function is continuous on a closed interval between negative 2 and 0, you can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove a root exists in that given interval. Using this theorem then guarantees that, if you check for a point, it will then have a corresponding value in that interval. So for example, if you had the point of f of x equals negative 1, you would then know that there's some value c that corresponds with that point between negative 2 and 0. There are a few things to keep in mind with the Intermediate Value Theorem. First, the value d does not have to be unique and may occur in multiple points in your function. Second, the theorem states that the value d exists between f of a and f of b, but it does not specify exactly what that value is. Note that this theorem heavily relies on the function being continuous since it will not always work with discontinuous functions due to holes and other undefined areas existing. Why is the Intermediate Value Theorem important? This theorem helps guarantee continuous functions on closed intervals will have a corresponding value for each of the values between the end points. This theorem also provides a base for many other theorems, concepts, and calculations. Let's review some of the applications of the Intermediate Value Theorem. First, it can be used to prove a point exists below or above a given line. Second, it can be used to find the existence of roots for functions, especially when it is difficult to algebraically do so. And finally, it is used when proving other theorems such as the Extreme Value Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem. And let's look at it on the interval between 1 and 2. Since the function is continuous with it being a polynomial and it is on a closed interval between 1 and 2, you can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove a root exists in that given interval. Let's start by getting the values of f of 1 and f of 2. So for f of 1, you get f of 1 equals 1 cubed minus 1 minus 2, which equals negative 2. For f of 2, you get 2 cubed minus 2 minus 2, which equals 4. Since f of 1 equals negative 2, which is less than 0, and f of 2 equals 4, which is greater than 0, plus f of x is continuous, then the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that f of x equals 0 at some point on your interval between 1 and 2. So again, note that that point will then be c. Since you can prove the function equals 0 at some point in this interval, then you can conclude at least one root exists between the values of 1 and 2 for your function. The Intermediate Value Theorem is used in many practical applications. In pharmacokinetics, this theorem can verify the concentration of a drug reaching therapeutic levels within a given timeframe. In economics, it can be used to show equilibrium points exist, such as a price that equalizes supply and demand. In physics, this theorem can be used to ensure feasible solutions exist when designing trajectories or optimizing structural components. The Intermediate Value Theorem is fairly straightforward once you understand the key properties of it. Even though this theorem is simple, it is the basis for many other mathematical concepts and applications. This wraps up continuity, along with a few corresponding theorems. Remember, in this course, you'll mainly work with continuous functions since many of the calculations will require that property. In the next chapter, you will dive into the world of derivatives.

Derivatives Introduction
What is a derivative? (4 min 52 seconds)
- Hi there. How are you feeling so far? You should be proud of yourself. Now, are you ready to expand upon your knowledge of limits? In this chapter, you will learn the second key concept of calculus, derivatives. You will learn what derivatives are, how to define the mus and limits and some key concepts about them. Let's start off by learning what a derivative is. A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable. It also represents the slope of a tangent line. What this does is tell you how quickly the output variable is changing compared to the input variable. The derivative of f of x with respect to x is defined by the following equation. So here you have the derivative f of x equal to the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h. As you could tell from the definition, derivatives have multiple things they can represent. You'll learn in the next few videos how to further interpret derivatives with respect to rate of change and slopes of tangent lines. You can also tell from the definition how closely related derivatives are to limits. This shows how important limits are to calculus and how basically everything in calculus is derived from limits. This is why understanding limits is key to understanding more complex concepts such as derivatives and later on in the course, integrals. Now, let's take a moment to break down the limit equation used to define a derivative. So in this case, you have your value x and a value h, and so h is a point that is a very short distance away from your value x. You also have your function represented by f and parentheses. So if you break this down, you have f prime of x, which represents your derivative, and you have the limit as h approaches zero. And so on the top portion you have f of x plus h, which represents the value of your function f at a point a short distance away from x. Then you subtract that by your function f at the point of x. What this top portion represents is the change in your function f of x over the small distance between x and h. You then divide this difference by your value h to get the average rate of change of your function f over the interval h. So bringing this all together where you have your limit of h going to zero, what this means is that you are going to get as close to zero as possible, since the value of zero for h would not be helpful in this case. So overall, what this does is it tells you the rate of change of function f of x as x is changing. Derivatives can be represented in a variety of forms. The following are the three main forms you will see them displayed as in this course. So the first one is f, and then the little tick symbol above it is what we call a prime symbol. And so I will call this f prime of x. Below that is going to be y, and then the prime symbol. So, again, that will be notated as y prime. And then finally you have dy divided by dx. So again, that is the three forms that the derivative can be in. So notate that sometimes I will call it f prime of x. Sometimes I will call it the derivative of x. It just depends. So why do you need to know about derivatives in the first place? Derivatives are key because they provide you a precise method to measure change in various fields and applications. Derivatives can be used to describe curvature and slope, find optimal points, and formulate differential equations. There are a multitude of real life applications for derivatives, for example, they're used in many physics equations like velocity and acceleration. In machine learning, derivatives are used to optimize functions and improve algorithms. In finance, they can be used to calculate profit and loss along with evaluating changes in the stock market. In seismology, they can be used to determine the magnitude range of earthquakes. This is just the beginning of derivatives. You'll continue to learn more about derivatives and see them in action throughout the rest of this course, even with integrals. Up next, let's take a moment to learn how to interpret derivatives as rate of change.

Rate if change (4 min 12 seconds)
- [Instructor] There are two main ways you can define derivatives. First, you can define them as a rate of change, and second, you can define them as the slope of a tangent line. Let's take a moment to understand derivatives as a rate of change. Rate of change is how quickly a quantity changes in relation to another quantity. You can define the instantaneous rate of change of a function f of x at a value a with its derivative f prime of a. Let's take a deeper look into this. Let's say you have a function f of x equals x cubed minus 2 multiplied by x plus 4. In this function, you have values of f of 0 equals 4, f of 1 equals 3, and f of 2 equals 8. So this means at f of 0, 4, you have x equals 0 and y equals 4. Now you may notice this function has decreased at some point between the values of 0 and 1 and has increased at some point between the values of 1 and 2. Note that this does not mean that at f of 1, the function is clearly decreasing because it did at some point between the values of 0 and 1, and it does not mean that f of 1 is clearly increasing with the function because it did at some point between the values of 1 and 2. Clearly this is conflicting, which will be explained later on. You also can't clearly state at the point f of 2 that the function is increasing at 2 because it did at some point between the values of 1 and 2. The only way to know for sure if a function is increasing or decreasing at a specific point is by taking its derivative. The way you determine if it is increasing or decreasing is by the sign of the derivative. If the derivative is positive, then the function is increasing at that point. If the derivative is negative, then the function is decreasing at that point. And finally, if the derivative is equal to 0, then it is neither increasing nor decreasing. Let's continue on with the example for your function f of x equals x cubed minus 2 multiplied by x plus 4. I will show you later on how to compute derivatives, but note that the derivative for this function is f prime of x equals 3 multiplied by x squared minus 2. If you evaluate your derivative at those three values, you'll get f prime of 0 equals -2, f prime of 1 equals 1, and f prime of 2 equals 10. From your results, you can interpret the derivatives and the signs of them to determine that the function f of x is decreasing at the point 0 and the function f of x is increasing at the points 1 and 2. Note that there should also be at least one point between the values of 0 and 1 such that the derivatives is equal to 0. This is proven by the intermediate value theorem. Let's take a look at the graph of the function you've been exploring. So this is the graph of the function f of x equals x cubed minus 2 multiplied by x plus 4. So you'll notice the three points on there are the three points you've been exploring, f of 0, f of 1, and f of 2. From this, you could tell that these match up with the derivatives where the function is decreasing at f of 0 and is increasing at f of 1 and f of 2. There are various applications for rate of change. For example, acceleration is the rate of change for velocity. Next, velocity is the rate of change of position. Temperature gradient is the rate of change of temperature. And finally, marginal revenue is the rate of change of profit. Derivatives are key to fining the rate of change at a specific point since they are the main method to ensure you actually properly determine if the function is increasing or decreasing at that point. Next, let's take a look at how to calculate derivatives using limits.

Calculating derivatives using limits (8 min 2 seconds)
- [Instructor] Before you go further, let's take a moment to teach you how to calculate derivatives using limits. Generally, you won't use this method to calculate derivatives, but it is important to understand the connection of derivatives to limits and how to calculate them with this method before you move on to more advanced methods. You'll use the definition of a derivative in the form of a limit. If you remember, the limit definition of a derivative is f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h. Once you plug in your function, you will then solve the equation using basic algebra to find your final solution. Let's go through a few examples using limits to calculate derivatives. Let's start off with the simple function of f of x equals x. So you have your formula f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus F of x divided by h. Now if you plug in your function x, you get f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of x plus h minus x divided by h. In this case, the x's cancel out, so f prime of x equals limit as h approaches zero of just h divided by h. You can then divide those to then get f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of one, which the limit of a constant value is itself, which is equal to one in this case. So the derivative of your function f of x equals x is equal to f prime of x equals one. Let's look at a slightly more complicated example. Let's say you have the function f of x equals x squared minus seven. So looking at your formula, f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h. This time it'll be a little bit more complicated plugging this into your formula. So if you do, you get f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of x plus h squared, noting that you need to have the x plus h where you had x before, minus seven, and then you'll subtract that by x squared minus seven since that is your function. And finally, divide all of that by h. Once you expand the first term, you'll then get f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of x squared plus two multiplied by x multiplied by h plus h squared minus seven minus x squared minus seven, divide all of that by h. In this case your x squared and seven terms will cancel out. So this gets you f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of two multiplied by x multiplied by h plus h squared divided by h. Since each of these terms has an h in it, you can then take that out to get the f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of two multiplied by x plus h, and in this case, since h is going to zero, you'll have two multiplied by x plus zero, meaning your final derivative for the function f of x equals x squared minus seven is f prime of x equals two multiplied by x. Let's take a look at the graph of the result of your last derivative and its corresponding function. On this graph, you can see the parabola. In blue is your function, f of x equals x squared minus seven, and then the straight red line through it is your derivative of two multiplied by x. You'll be able to observe the relationship between the function and its derivative, such as how where the function is decreasing on the left side, the derivative is going to be a negative value. And then on the right side, where the function is increasing, the derivative is a positive value. This corresponds with having the slope of the tangent line being either positive or negative to reflect what is going on with the function itself. Let's take a look at a little bit more complicated example. Where this time, you'll get the derivative for the function f of x equals sine of x. Let's use your formula of f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h. Plugging in your function sine of x, you get f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of sine of x plus h, making sure you have both x and h in there. Subtract that by your function sine of x and divide all that by h. You can use the sine addition formula of sine of x plus h equal to sine of x multiplied by cosine of h plus cosine of x multiplied by sine of h in order to simplify your derivative. So let's plug this in to get f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches zero of sine of x multiplied by cosine of h plus cosine of x, multiplied by sine of h, minus sine of x, and then make sure you divide all of that by h. Next, let's factor the sine and cosine terms to get f prime of x equals limit as h approaches zero of sine of x multiplied by cosine of h minus one plus cosine of x multiplied by sine of h. Divide all of that by h. Now let's split this up to get two different limits. So the limit as h to approaches zero of sine of x multiplied by cosine of h minus one and then the limit as h approaches zero of cosine of x multiplied by sine of h divided by h. To simplify solving this, you can use the facts of these following two limits where you have the limit of h approaches zero of sine of h divided by h is equal to one, and then the limit as h approaches zero of cosine of h minus one divided by h is equal to zero. Let's plug these in to get the limit as h approaches zero of sine of x multiplied by cosine of h minus one divided by h is equal to sine of x multiplied by zero, which in this case equals just zero. Next, let's get the limit as h approaches zero of cosine of x multiplied by sine of h divided by h, which is equal to cosine of x multiplied by one. This means your result is cosine of x. Let's plug this back into your derivative, f prime of x equal to cosine of x plus zero, which gets you a final result of the derivative of your function. f of x equals sine of x to be f prime of x equals cosine of x. Let's take a look at the graph of your function and its corresponding derivative. In this graph, you'll see the function sine of x and cosine of x, and notice how they have oscillating behavior where they are kind of like waves that go up and down as they go across the graph. You'll notice, like with the previous graph, how where one function is increasing, it will then have positive values in the other function and vice versa. If a function is decreasing, then the corresponding function will have negative values. In this graph, the function cosine of x is the one represented in blue where the value at x equals zero has a y value of one, and then your function sine of x is represented by the red line, which has a value of x equals zero corresponding with a value of y equals zero. Now that you know how to calculate derivatives using the limit definition, you'll be better prepared for the following videos when I use this limit definition to better explain some derivative concepts. It is also good to know how to compute derivatives this way and appreciate how they're made, even when you learn tricks later on to shorten your calculations. Up next, let's learn about the other way to define derivatives, which is going to be with tangent lines and slopes.

Tangent lines and slopes (6 min 36 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next, let's take a moment to understand derivatives as the slope of a tangent line. Before I explain this concept, though, let's take a moment to understand secant lines. A secant line is a line that intersects at least two distinct points of another line. You can use the slope of a secant line at a point a, f of a to estimate the rate of change where the output changes in relation to the input. You can obtain the slope of a secant line at points x, f of x and a, f of a with the equation f of x minus f of a, divided by x minus a. You can replace x in this equation with the values a plus h, where h is a value close to 0. This gets you the equation f of a plus h, minus f of a, divided by a plus h minus a. You can simplify the denominator to f of a plus h, minus f of a, divided by h. This should look familiar to your derivative definition that you saw earlier. In this graph, you can see a secant line, so you have the parabola that looks like a U with the blue line, and then you have a red line going through it. This is a secant line because it is touching the blue line in two distinct points. Now, let's look at how secant lines relate to tangent lines in a graphical sense. With this graph, you can see a blue line, which is kind of like a squiggle, and then a red line going through it. So you'll be able to tell it is a secant line since it is going through at least two points in that line that are distinct. The part I want you to focus on, though, is the part at x equals 0, where the red line is touching the blue line at y equals 1. This is what you will call the tangent line, so you'll see how you can get a tangent line and a secant line at the same time. Note that it is very common for your secant lines to slowly approach your tangent line as h gets closer to 0. Since the secant line approaches the tangent line, the tangent line can take on the same definition for the function where it has a slope of f of x minus f of a, divided by x minus a. You can then use the technique I showed you with the secant line slope to then simplify this to the definition of a derivative, where you have f of a plus h minus f of a divided by h. This means the slope of the line at point a is the rate of change of the function f of x at point a. So here is another example of a tangent line going through a graph. So, this is similar to the last one, where you have that blue kind of squiggle going through with your function, and then you have the red tangent line going through it. So again, it is technically secant line as well because it's going through multiple points, but it's a tangent line because it is representing the slope of the function at x equals 0, and in this case, y equals 1, where it is intersecting your function. Let's look at a few examples of finding a tangent line. Let's say you have a function f of x equals x squared and you want to find the tangent line at x equals 3. Let's apply your limit definition of the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x minus f of a, divided by x minus a. Plugging in your value of a equals 3, you'll get the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x minus f of 3, divided by x minus 3. Now, let's plug in your function x squared to get you the limit as x approaches 3 of x squared minus 3 squared since, again, you're applying your function to the f of 3 value and still divide by x minus 3. You can factor the top portion of this fraction to get the limit as x approaches 3 of x minus 3, multiplied by x plus 3, divided by x minus 3. Now, you can cancel out both x minus 3 terms to simply get the limit as x approaches 3 of x plus 3. Substituting in your value of 3 for x, you get the limit as x approaches 3 is 3 plus 3, which equals 6. Now you know the slope for your tangent line, where x is 3 is equal to 6. If you want to find the full equation for your tangent line, you can plug in your value x equals 3 into your function f of x equals x squared. So, if you plug this in, you get f of 3 equals 3 squared, which equals 9. This means the point your tangent line will be at is 3, 9 with a slope of 6. You can use the point-slope equation of a line, where you have y minus y1 equals m multiplied by x minus x1 to get y minus 9, equals 6 multiplied by x minus 3. This simplifies to y equals 6 multiplied by x minus 9 as the full equation for your tangent line where x equals 3. Let's look at this in a graph. Like you learned before, since the derivative you got was positive, it means that the function is increasing at the point x equals 3. Looking at the tangent line and the graph of your function, this is a parent. So you have your function, which is a parabola of x squared, where you have the blue line and it looks like a U, and then you have your red line, which is your tangent line, and then I have a blue point at x equals 3. So you'll see that this does match up to your point of 3, 9 that you found earlier, and you'll see that it has that pretty steep slope of 6. So, like I mentioned before, this is a parent that the function is increasing at that particular point on the graph. Finding the slope of a tangent line is not only helpful, but a useful way to interpret derivatives. It is a parent that, in a way, they are still measuring the rate of change since it is measuring the rate of change at that particular point for the function, which becomes very clear when it is graphed. Next, let's take a look at continuity with derivatives.

Continuity with derivatives (5 min 55 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next up, let's talk about continuity derivatives and how these two topics are related. You learned about continuity in the previous chapter, so let's take a moment to review what a continuous function is. Remember, a function f is continuous at a point x equals a where the following three conditions are true. One, the function f is defined at the point x equals a. Two, the function has a limit that exists as x approaches a. Three, the limit as x approaches a is f of x equals f of a. If this is not the case, then the function is discontinuous at that point. Also remember that a function f of x is continuous on an open interval a to b if it is continuous for all points within that interval. Now, let's take a look at what differentiable means. A function f of x is differentiable at a point x equals a if the derivative f prime of a exists. To expand upon that, a function f of x is differentiable on an interval a to b if the derivative f prime of a exists for every point on the interval. Now, let's see how these two topics are related. It is stated that if a function f of x is differentiable at a point x equals a, then that function f of x is continuous at that point x equals a. You can prove this by showing the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals f of a. I want to make it clear from this definition that this means differentiability implies continuity. This means a point of a function is only differentiable if it is continuous. Note that this does not work the other way around, meaning continuity does not automatically imply differentiability. For example, let's look at the function f of x equals absolute value of x, and you want to see if this function is continuous and differentiable at x equals 0. First, let's see if this function is continuous at this point. You could do this by taking the limit as x approaches 0 of the absolute value of x. In this case, you could plug in your value of 0 to get the absolute value of 0, which equals just 0. Since this is an appropriate finite result, this means that your function is continuous at this point. Next, let's see if this function is differentiable using limits. In this case, you'll have f prime of x equals the limit as x approaches h of f of a plus h minus f of a divided by h. Remember, this is the limit definition of your derivative. Let's plug in your value of 0 for a, which gets you f prime of x equals limit as x approaches 0 of f of 0 plus h minus f of 0 divided by h. Now, let's plug in your function, which in this case is going to be the absolute value signs, so you'll have f prime of x equals the limit as x approaches 0 of the absolute value of 0 plus h minus the absolute value 0 divided by h. In this case, you will need to evaluate the limit from both sides with the left hand limit and the right hand limit to ensure that they equal. For this particular function, if you have the absolute value of h, this is equal to h for values of h greater than or equal to 0. Now, if you have the absolute value of h for values of h less than 0, then it is equal to -h. Let's get those left and right hand limits. Getting the left hand limit, you get the limit as x approaches 0 from the left of the absolute value of h divided by h by simplifying the limit you saw in the previous slide, which equals the limit as x approaches 0 from the left of -h divided by h since you're going from that left side. And then this simplifies to the limit as x approaches 0 from the left is -1, which is just equal to -1 since it is a constant value. Now, let's get the right hand limit, which is the limit as x approaches 0 from the right of absolute value of h divided by h, which equals the limit as x approaches 0 from the right of h divided by h, which equals the limit as x approaches 0 from the right of 1, which again since it is a constant value equals 1. In this case, your left hand limit of limit of x approaches 0 from the left of absolute value of h divided by h is not equal to your right hand limit of the limit as x approaches 0 from the right of absolute value of h divided by h. This means f of x equals the absolute value of x is continuous, but not differentiable at the point x equals 0. Hence, this is a great example where you have a function that has continuity but not differentiability. In summary, you have learned that if a derivative exists at a certain point for a function, then the function must be continuous at that point. However, the reverse is not always the case if a function is continuous at a point, meaning it is also differentiable at that point, like you saw in the previous example. Next, you will explore how to compute with differentiation.

Computing with differentiation (2 min 37 seconds)
- [Instructor] So far, you have calculated derivatives using the limit definition of a derivative. This is a great method to know that will come in handy since you can always use this method to calculate derivatives, even if they end up being a bit tricky. As you may have noticed though, finding a derivative with this method often takes many steps that may sometimes be unnecessary. There are a variety of situations where using the limit definition method may not be needed when deriving. You will learn a variety of rules to speed up and simplify your derivative calculations, such as the power rule to automatically know how to deal with derivatives that contain a power. There are also cases such as trigonometric derivatives where it will be easiest to memorize the derivatives for these functions since they tend to be computationally expensive, as you saw in a previous example. So what is this term differentiation? Differentiation is the process of finding derivatives. Note that all the methods you will learn to solve derivatives in the following chapters using a variety of differentiation techniques will all stem from the limit definition of a derivative. So if you remember, the definition is f prime of x equals the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h subtracted by f of x. Divide all that by h. Note that all the differentiation techniques can also be proven using this limit definition of a derivative. In the following chapters, you'll begin by learning some key differentiation rules you can use to better understand how to work with derivatives and speed up the overall process. Next, you'll learn about some derivatives of some common function types, including some where I will recommend that you memorize them. Finally, you'll learn about higher order derivatives and more advanced differentiation techniques such as implicit and logarithmic differentiation. Throughout the rest of the course, you will seldom see the limit definition of derivatives used to understand and solve derivatives. Remember, it is still important to know every derivative can be solved using that technique, but I will show you how to find faster and easier methods to solve derivatives. This wraps up the basics of derivatives and how to compute them using the limit definition. Remember, derivatives are a key concept for calculus and help measure the rate of change.

Differentiation Rules
Differentiation Rules (1 min 42 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you'll explore many of the common rules for derivatives. Remember, a derivative represents the rate of change of a function. Let's start by going over the differentiation rules in this chapter. The differentiation rules you'll explore are constant/constant multiple, sum/difference, product/quotient, power, and chain. There are a few cases for the constant rule and the sum and difference rules will be explored together since they are similar to each other. In the following chapter, you will explore derivatives of common types of functions such as trigonometric and exponential functions that have their own rules. Each of the following videos will be structured similarly to give you a general overview of each differentiation rule. Each video will provide you with the definition of the rule, the reasoning of why it is needed, and multiple examples of how to calculate derivatives using the rule. It is important to know how to not only understand the key rules for differentiation, but also how to use them to calculate derivatives in various scenarios. Derivatives are fundamental to calculus, so understanding how to calculate them using the rules when needed will help you better understand other key concepts later on, such as integrals. The goal of the following videos is to provide you with working knowledge on how to implement these various differentiation rules. You can take this knowledge and expand upon it in your own work and education. Let's get started with exploring constant rules.

Constant rules (3 min 48 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's begin by exploring the constant rules for derivatives. There are two constant rules you will cover in this video: the constant rule and the constant multiple rule. Let's start with the constant rule. The constant rule states for any constant c where your function f of x equals c, then the derivative of that function f prime of xequals zero. This makes sense since the graph of any constant value has a slope of zero. Note that this is the same even if the constant c equals zero. Since the derivative is the slope of the tangent line at a particular point in a function, then, in this case, since the original slope is zero, the derivative will also equal zero. Let's look at an example of the constant rule. Let's say you have a function f of x equals 8. If you take the derivative of it, you can use the constant rule to get f prime of x equals zero. Next, let's look at the constant multiple rule. The constant multiple rule states for a function g of x equals c multiplied by a function f of x for any constant c, the derivative for your function g prime of x equals c multiplied by f prime of x. You will notice this is very similar to the constant multiple rule for limits. You might be a bit confused as to why the constant stays the same for the constant multiple rule when the previous constant rule made the constant go to zero. This is because of how limits work, since the limit of a constant is always itself. Hence, the derivative of a constant multiplied can be taken aside from the equation and put back in with the final result. This rule can simplify the process when deriving functions by allowing you to move that constant outside of the function you are deriving. Let's look an example of this rule in action. Let's say you have a function f of x equal to 3 multiplied by x. If you wish to take the derivative of this, you can start off by ignoring the constant 3, since it will stay the same. Now you just need to take the derivative of x, which, as you learned previously, is simply equal to 1. Now you can bring back in your constant 3, so you'll have 3 multiplied by your derivative of x, which is equal to 3 multiplied by 1. And now you have a final derivative of f prime of x equal 3. Let's look at one more example of this. Let's say you have a function f of x equal to x divided by 5. You might be worried at first, since you are dividing your function x by the constant 5, but this is actually the same as multiplying your function x by the fraction 1/5. Since you are multiplying it by 1/5, you can still use the constant multiple rule. So now you just need to simply derive your function X, which, like before, is equal to 1. Now you can bring your constant 1/5 back into the equation, so you have 1/5 multiplied by your derivative of X, which equals 1/5 multiplied by 1, and so now you have a final derivative of 1/5. This should give you a solid understanding of how to use the constant rule and constant multiple rule. These rules are simple, yet effective when it comes to knowing how to quickly and easily solve derivatives, especially when the functions within them become more complicated. Up next, let's explore sum and difference rules.

Sum and difference rules (5 min 41 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next are the sum and difference rules for derivatives. These rules are essentially one and the same, but they're sometimes referenced separately. It is important to know how both of these rules work, since they can be extremely helpful when solving derivatives. Let's start off by exploring the sum rule. The sum rule states the derivative of a sum of functions is the same as the sum of their derivatives. This is represented by the functions H of X equal to the function F of X plus the function G of X. Then you have the derivative of H of X equal to the derivative of F of X, added with the derivative of G of X. Next, let's explore the difference rule. The difference rule states the derivative of a difference of functions is the same as the difference of their derivatives. This is represented by the functions H of X equal to the function F of X, subtracted by the function G of X, where you have the derivative of H of X equal to the derivative of F of x, subtracted by the derivative of G of X. As you could tell, these rules are very similarly defined. Sometimes they're referenced together and represented by the following equations. So you have H of X equal to the function F of x plus or minus the function G of X, where the derivative of H of X is equal to the derivative of F of X added, or subtracted by the derivative of G of X. How do these rules work? When you take a derivative, you are finding the rate of change for a function. Since you have two separate functions when you add or subtract them from each other, you can handle the functions individually to find their rates of change. Once you find this for each function, you can combine the results in order to get your final result. Let's look at a few examples of these rules in action. Let's start off with an example for the sum rule. Let's say you have the function F of X equal to 45 plus X. Since you're adding these two functions together, you can separate them to calculate your derivatives. So again, using your rule F of X equal to G of X, plus H of X. In this case, G of X equals 45 and H of X equals X. As you saw from the previous video, the derivative of a constant is zero, so your G prime of X is equals zero. And as you know from previous knowledge, the derivative of X is one. So H prime of X equals one. So now you bring back your rule where you have F prime of X equal to G prime of X, plus H prime of X, and let's plug in those values you got. So your final derivative F prime of X equals zero plus one, which gives you a final derivative of one. Let's look at another example, but this time with the difference rule. Let's say you have the function F of X equal to six, multiplied by X, subtracted by two, multiplied by X. Again, you will separate these two functions to calculate their derivatives. So this time you have the rule F of X equal to G of X subtracted by H of X. So you have your function G of X equal to six multiplied by X and your function H of X equal to two multiplied by X. Using the constant multiple rule and the knowledge that the derivative of X is one, you can then separate these derivatives. So you have G prime of X equal to six multiplied by one, which is six, and then you have your derivative of H of X, which is two multiplied by one, which equals two. Bring this back together with your rule of F prime of X equals G prime of X minus H prime of X to get your derivative of F of X. So here, you have six minus two, which gets you a final derivative of four. Let's look at one more example where these rules are combined together. Let's say you have the function F of X equal to nine, multiplied by X, subtracted by X, added with two. Here, you'll have the function F of X equal to G of X, minus H of X plus J of X. So you have your function G of X, which is nine, multiplied by X, your function H of X, which is equal to X, and finally your function J of X, which is equal to two. So even though you have three functions this time with both addition and subtraction, the separation process is the same as before, where again, you'll separate them, calculate their derivatives individually, and then combine them together in the final result. So using the constant multiple rule and the knowledge that the derivative of X is one, you will then have G prime of X equal to nine multiplied by one, which gets you a derivative of nine. You'll have your derivative H prime of X equal to one, and your derivative of J prime of X equal to zero. So now we will combine all of these results together for F prime of X equal to G prime of X, minus H prime of X, plus J prime of X. This gets you a final derivative of F of X equal to nine minus one plus zero, which equals eight for your final result. This should give you a solid understanding of how to use the sum and difference rules with derivatives. These rules are super helpful to use to separate out a derivative to make it easier to calculate in smaller pieces. Up next, let's explore the power rule.

Power rule (4 min 52 seconds)
- [Instructor] You may have noticed that I have not shown you any derivative examples of functions with exponents other than 1 so far. This is because there is a whole rule of how to deal with exponents called the power rule. The power rule states for a function f of x equal x to the n with a constant value n, the derivative is f prime of x equal to n multiplied by x to the n minus 1. An easy way to think about this rule is you take the current exponent, multiply that with the function as a constant value, and then reduce the current x exponent by 1. You may notice that you have essentially been using this rule to get the derivative of x so far. Since x is technically x to the 1, you may notice that you have essentially been using this rule to get the derivative of x so far. So you have your function f of x equal to x, but this is actually the same as x to the 1. So when you get your derivative of f of x, you have f prime of x equal to your current exponent of 1, so you have 1 multiplied by x, and then you have it to the 1 minus 1. So this is equal to 1 multiplied by x to the zero, which is equal to 1 multiplied by 1 to get you a final derivative of 1 for your function of x. This rule can be proven by using multiple techniques such as mathematical induction and the binomial theorem. I suggest taking time on your own to explore these proofs if you wish to have a more thorough understanding of the why behind how this rule works. Long story short, as you take the limits of the function, everything cancels out accordingly to provide you with the power rule. Let's look at a few examples of the power rule in action. Let's get the derivative for the function f of x equal to 5 multiplied by x squared. Using the constant multiple rule, you can separate out the constant 5 to focus on just your function x squared for now. So if you get the derivative of the function of x squared, you will then bring your power of 2 down, so you have 2 multiplied by x, and that's going to be to the 2 minus 1. Since again, you're subtracting 1 from your current power. This gets you 2 multiplied by x to the 1, and now you could bring in your constant 5. So you have 5 multiplied by your derivative of your function, f of x, so this will be 5 multiplied by 2 multiplied by x, which gets you a final derivative of 10 multiplied by x. Let's look at one more example. Let's get the derivative for the function f of x equal to 3 multiplied by x to the fourth plus 7 times x to the tenth. Here you'll be using your sum rule, so you have f of x equal to g of x plus h of x. You have g of x equal to 3 multiplied by x to the fourth, and h of x equal to 7, multiplied by x to the tenth. Let's start by getting the derivative of g of x. For now, let's separate out the constants 3 and 7, and we'll come back to adding those back in later. So to get the derivative of g of x for x to the fourth, you will simply bring the exponent of 4 down, so 4 multiplied by x to the 4 minus 1. So your derivative of g of x is going to be 4 multiplied by x cubed. And then next you have h of x, so again, this is going to be the derivative of x to the tenth. Bring down that 10, so you have 10 multiplied by x, and now you have it to the 10 minus 1. So you have your derivative of h prime of x equal to 10 multiplied by x to the 9. Now let's bring this together with the constant multiple and the sum rules to get 3 multiplied by g prime of x plus 7 multiplied by h prime of x. This gets you the derivative of f of x equal to 3 multiplied by 4 multiplied by x to the 3, plus 7 multiplied by 10 multiplied by x to the ninth. When you simplify this, you get a final derivative result of f prime of x equal to 12 multiplied by x to the 3 plus 70 times x to the 9. The power rule is very important and will be heavily used in the following videos with a variety of functions. Remembering the easy trick of multiplying the exponent by the function, then subtracting 1 from the exponent will significantly speed up the process of calculating many derivatives. Up next, let's increase the complexity and learn about the product rule.

Product rule (5 min 54 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at the product rule. Note that this rule is similar to the quotient rule, but they will be discussed separately due to their complexity and importance. Let's start off with the definition. The product rule states the derivative of a product of functions only works if each of the functions are differentiable individually. If they are differentiable, then the product rule states the derivative of the functions h of X equals the function f of x multiplied by the function g of x. Then the derivative of h prime of x equals f prime of x multiplied by g of x, plus f of x multiplied by g prime of x. You may wonder why you don't just multiply the two functions together. For example, how you would with the sum and difference rules where you simply add or subtract them from each other. Let's look at an example as to why this does not work. Let's say you have the function f of x and it is equal to x squared multiplied by x cubed. If you've simply multiplied these together to get x to the fifth, then you'll get a derivative of f of x equals five multiplied by x to the fourth. Now, let's get the derivatives first and then multiply them together. So here you have your function g of x equal to x squared and your function h of x equal to x cubed. If you get the derivative of g of x, you get g prime of x equal to two multiplied by x. If you get the derivative of h of x, you get h prime of x equal to three multiplied by x squared. Now let's multiply these derivatives together. So you have g prime of x multiplied by h prime of x, which equals two multiplied by x, and you multiply that by three multiplied by x squared. If you simplify this, you get six multiplied by x cubed as your final result. As you could see, the derivative of a product of functions is not equal to the product of the derivatives of the functions. The product rule can be proven using multiple techniques such as mathematical induction and implicit differentiation. I suggest taking time on your own to explore these proofs if you wish to have a more thorough understanding of the why behind how this rule works. Long story short, as you take the limits of the two functions being multiplied together, everything simplifies to provide you with the product rule. Let's look at an example of the product rule in action. Let's get the derivative for the function f of x equal to x squared multiplied by three, multiplied by x plus two. So here, you have f of x equal to g of x multiplied by h of x, so you'll have g of x equal to x squared and h of x equal to three multiplied by x plus two. Let's begin by getting the derivatives of g of x and h of x. So you have g prime of x equal to two multiplied by x using the power rule, and then you have the derivative h prime of x equals three, since, again, the two is going to cancel up to zero, and the derivative of x is one, so it'll just be three multiplied by one, which leaves it to just three. Now let's bring in the product rule. So here, you have f prime of x equal to g prime of x, multiplied by h of x plus g of x multiplied by h prime of x. Let's plug in your different values for this. So you have f prime of x equal to two multiplied by x. Then you'll multiply that by three multiplied by x plus two, and then you'll add x squared multiplied by three. Let's simplify this a little bit to get six multiplied by x squared, plus four, multiplied by x, plus three, multiplied by x squared. Add these like terms together to get a final result of f prime of x equal to nine multiplied by x squared, plus four multiplied by x. Let's look at another example. Let's get the derivative of f of x equal to x cubed multiplied by two, multiplied by x minus one. And so again, here, you have your function f of x equal to g of x multiplied by h of x. So g of x is equal to x cubed and h of x is equal to two multiplied by x minus one. Let's get their individual derivatives. So you have g prime of x equal to three multiplied by x squared using the power rule, and then you have h prime of x equal to two, since again, the derivative of x is one and the derivative of negative one, which is a constant value, is zero. Bring back in your product rules. So you have f prime of x equal to g prime of x multiplied by h of x plus g of x multiplied by h prime of x. Plug in your values to get f prime of x equal to three multiplied by x squared, and you'll multiply that by two multiplied by x minus one, and then you'll add x cubed multiplied by two. This simplifies to six multiplied by x cubed minus three multiplied by x squared, plus two multiplied by x cubed. Simplify this more to get a final result of f prime of x equal to eight, multiplied by x cubed, minus three multiplied by x squared. The product rule is not quite as intuitive as the previous rules, so it is important to properly memorize this rule since it will be frequently utilized. Next, you'll learn about the quotient rule, where you'll see how it works similarly to the product rule, but it has its own twist.

Quotient rule (5 min 55 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next, let's explore the quotient rule. This rule operates similarly to the product rule, where you can't just simply divide or multiply functions together to get their combined derivative. Let's start off with the definition. The quotient rule states the derivative of a quotient of functions only works if each of the functions are differentiable individually. If they are differentiable, then the derivative for the function h of x, which is equal to the function f of x divided by the function of g of x is then equal to h prime of x, which equals f prime of x multiplied by g of x, subtracted by f of x, multiplied by g prime of x, divide all of that by g of x squared. The derivative for the quotient rule is similar to the product rule with the overall format, especially with that top part of the quotient rule. There are a few differences where with the product rule, you add the two sets of functions and derivatives together, versus the quotient rules, you subtract them from each other. You also need to divide everything by the second function squared with the quotient rule, versus the product rule, you don't need to do that. Like before, you may wonder why you don't just divide the two functions by each other. Let's look at an example as to why this does not work. Let's say you have the function f of x equal to x squared divided by x to the seventh. This is equal to one divided by x to the fifth, or x to the minus five. If you simply get the derivative of this, it is going to equal minus five divided by x to the sixth, or minus five multiplied by x to the minus sixth. Now let's get the derivatives first, and then divide them by each other. So, let's have g of x equal to x squared and h of x equal to x to the seventh. So using the power rule for both of these, you have g prime of x equal to two multiplied by x, and then h prime of x equal to seven multiplied by x to the sixth. Now, let's divide these two derivatives by each other, so you have g prime of x divided by h prime of x, which is equal to two multiplied by x, divided by seven, multiplied by x to the sixth. If you simplify this, you get two divided by seven multiplied by x to the fifth. As you could see, the derivative of the quotient of functions is not equal to the quotient of the derivatives of the functions. The quotient rule can be proven using multiple techniques, such as mathematical induction and logarithmic differentiation. I suggest taking time on your own to explore these proofs if you wish to have a more thorough understanding of the why behind how this rule works. Long story short, as you take the limits of the two functions being divided by each other, everything simplifies to provide you with the quotient rule. Let's look at a few examples using the quotient rule. First, let's get the derivative for the function f of x, which is equal to five multiplied by x squared, divided by four, multiplied by x plus three. So here you have f of x equal to g of x divided by h of x. In this case, your function g of x is equal to five multiplied by x squared, and your function, h of x is equal to four multiplied by x plus three. Using the rules you've learned so far, your derivative for g of x is g prime of x equal to 10 multiplied by X, and then your derivative for h of x, h prime of x is equal to four. Now let's bring in your quotient rule where you have f prime of x equal to g prime of x, multiplied by h of x, subtracted by g of x, multiplied by h prime of x, and you'll divide all of that by h of x squared. Let's plug in your values to get f prime of x equal to 10 multiplied by x, and then you multiply that by four, multiplied by x plus three, subtract that by four, multiplied by five, multiplied by x squared. You're going to divide all of that by four multiplied by x plus three squared. This then simplifies to a final result of 20 multiplied by x squared plus 30 multiplied by x, dividing all of that by four, multiplied by x plus three squared. Let's look at another example. Let's get the derivative for the function f of x equal to x plus one divided by x squared plus four multiplied by X. So here you have your function f of x equal to g of x divided by h of x. So you have your function g of x equal to x plus one, and your function h of x equal to x squared plus four multiplied by X. Using the rules you've learned so far, you have g prime of x equal to one and h prime of x equal to two multiplied by x plus four. Now let's use your quotient rule f prime of x equal to g prime of x, multiplied by h of x, minus g of x, multiplied by h prime of x, divided by h of x squared. Plug in your values to get one multiplied by x squared plus four times x. Subtract that by x plus one multiplied by two times x plus four. Divide all of this by x squared plus four times x, and square that whole thing. Once you simplify this, you get a final result of negative x squared minus two multiplied by x minus four. Divide all of that by x squared plus four times x, and again, that whole bottom portion is squared. The quotient rule is also not as intuitive, just like the product rule, so it is important to properly memorize the technique, since it will be frequently utilized in the following videos. In the next video, you'll wrap up this chapter by exploring the chain rule.

Chain rule (8 min 24 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up this chapter by learning about the chain rule. The previous rules you learned will help with many functions you will get derivatives for but not for all them. This is where the chain rule comes in handy. There are a variety of functions, such as these, that will not work with the rules you currently learned. This is because they are functions with functions. Some of these functions you will learn more about in the following chapter. When you have a function within a function, it is sometimes called the composition of f and g. It can be represented by two different notations, so it can either be represented by parenthesis f and a little circle g of x or by f and then parenthesis g(x). Note that the composition of f of g of x is not always equal to the composition of g of f of x. So again, note that you can't necessarily flip these. Now that you understand what composite functions are, let's explore the chain rule. The chain rule states the derivative of a function within a function only works if each of the functions are differentiable individually. If they are differentiable, then the derivative for the functions h(x) equals f(g(x)) is then equal to h'(x) equals f'(g(x)) multiplied by g'(x). As you could see, the derivative for the chain rule can be more complicated to understand than the previous rules you explored. The first part is understanding what function is the outer one and which function is the inner one. The second part is understanding how to take the derivatives of the inner and outer functions since, sometimes, they could be a bit complicated. Let's begin by looking at a few examples for how to identify what the inner function is and what the outer function is. So these are some of the previous examples you saw. So you have f(x) equal to ln of x to the fifth plus x to the minus five. In this case, your inner function is going to be x to the five plus x to the minus five, and your outer function is going to be ln(u). So you'll note that's, oftentimes, the outer function uses u to, essentially, represent the variable. Next, you have f(x) equal to the square root of three multiplied by x squared plus eight. In this case, your inner function is three multiplied by x squared plus eight, and your outer function is the square root of u. Finally, you have f(x) equal to e to the x to the fifth minus four multiplied by x squared plus four. In this case, your inner function is x to the fifth minus four multiplied by x squared plus four, and then your outer function is simply e to the u. Now, let's take a moment to dissect the chain rule now that you've reviewed it and you've seen kind of how the inner and outer functions work. So first, you have your h'(x), which represents your whole function, is equal to the f' portion. So this portion is saying you want to get the derivative of the outer function. Now, the g(x) inside of it is where you will evaluate the derivative of the outer function at that specific point g(x), then you have your second portion multiplied by g'(x), which is simply just getting the derivative of the inner function and multiplying it by the first chunk. Let's look at why you need the chain rule in the first place. Let's say you have the function f(x) equal to the square root of four multiplied by x plus seven. Let's say you just use the power rule to solve this. If you do so, you'll get a result of f'(x) equal to one half multiplied by four multiplied by x plus seven to the minus 0.5. This is, unfortunately, not the correct result since the correct derivative is actually f'(x) equal to two multiplied by four multiplied by x plus seven to the negative 0.5. So you'll notice, instead of it being one half, it's actually two. So again, even though this is a minor change, note that for some of the other examples, it's a very major difference. The chain rule can be proven using the limit definition and the mean value theorem. I suggest taking time on your own to explore this proof if you wish to have a more thorough understanding of the why behind how the chain rule works. Long story short, as you take the limits of the two composite functions, you use the difference quotient and mean value theorem to simplify everything which gets you the chain rule. Let's look at a few examples using the chain rule. Let's get the derivative for your function f(x) equal to three multiplied by x plus two, and take all that to the fourth. So let's find the composite function so you have f(x) equals g(h(x)). So in this case, your outer function, g(x), is equal to u to the fourth. So again, u is going to represent that unknown variable, and then h(x) is going to be your inner function, which is going to be inside those parenthesis, so it'll be three multiplied by x plus two. Now, let's get the derivatives of those two individual functions for the chain rule. So g'(x) is equal to four multiplied by u cubed, and then h'(x) is equal to just three. Using your chain rule, so you have f'(x) equal to g'(h(x)) multiplied by h'(x), you'll plug in your values to get f'(x) equals four multiplied by three multiplied by x plus two cubed. So again, you'll see you used your h(x) and plugged it into where that u was in the derivative of your g'(x), and then you're going to multiply that by your derivative of h'(x), which is just three. Once you simplify this a little bit, you get a final result of f'(x) equals 12 multiplied by three multiplied by x plus two to the third. Let's take a look at another example. Let's get the derivative for the function f(x) equals two multiplied by x plus three. Divide all that by six minus x squared, and you're going to take all of that to the third. So again, you have composite functions f(x) equal to g(h(x)). So in this case, g(x) is going to equal u cubed, and then h(x) is going to equal two multiplied by x plus three divided by six minus x squared. So again, g(x) is your outer function, and h(x) is your inner function. So in this case, using the power rule, g'(x) is equal to three multiplied by u squared, and then using the quotient rule, h'(x) is equal to two multiplied by six minus x squared. Subtract that by two, multiplied by x plus three. Multiply that by negative two multiplied by x, and then you'll divide everything by six minus x squared and then square that. Now, let's use your chain rule, f'(x) equal to g'(h(x)) multiplied by h'(x) to get a result of f'(x) equals three multiplied by two multiplied by x plus three divided by six minus x squared squared, and then you multiply that by two multiplied by six minus x squared minus two multiplied by x plus three multiplied by negative two multiplied by x. Divide all that by six minus x squared, and then square that. Note that there is an extended version of the chain rule. So if you have a composition of three or more functions, then you simply keep applying the chain rule as many times as there are functions. For example, if you have three composite functions g(x) equal to h(f(g(x))), then your chain rule dictates the derivative g'(x) is equal to h'(f(g(x))) multiplied by f'(g(x)) multiplied by g'(x). So again, here, you're just using the chain rule twice. So if you need to do it four or five, six or more times, you just keep expanding that. The chain rule can be a complicated one, but it is very necessary to work with more advanced problems where there are multiple functions within functions. This will be very apparent when you begin working with trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions. This wraps up your introduction to differentiation rules. These rules are all very important and will be frequently used throughout future videos to take derivatives. I suggest take your time on your own to make sure you are familiar with these rules and to continue practicing them with different functions. In the next chapter, you'll explore many of the common derivatives for various functions.

Common Derivatives
Polynomial and rational derivatives (4 min 59 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you'll explore many common derivatives. These derivatives will be drawn from many of the functions you learned about earlier in this course. Let's start off with derivatives for polynomial and rational functions. Both of these types of derivatives are fairly easy to work with once you are familiar with the differentiation rules you learned about previously. For polynomial functions, you just need to work with the constant, constant multiple, sum, difference, and power rules. For rational functions, you need to work with the quotient, constant, constant multiple, sum, difference, and power rules. You'll notice the main difference for the rational functions is just using the quotient rule as well. Let's look an example of a polynomial derivative. Let's get the derivative of the polynomial function, f of x equal to 2 multiplied by x to the 7th, plus 9 multiplied by x to the 3rd, minus 6 multiplied by x. You'll notice this polynomial function will require the constant, multiple, sum, difference, and power rules to solve. Let's look at each term individually. Let's get the derivative of 2 multiplied by x to the 7th. So, you can move the 2 to the outside so you have 2, and then you will bring down the power to get 2 multiplied by 7, multiplied by x to the 6th, which simplifies to 14 multiplied by x to the 6th. Next, let's get the derivative for 9 multiplied by x cubed. So again, you can move the 9 to the outside, and your derivative for x cubed is simply 3 multiplied by x squared, so you'll have 9 multiplied by 3, multiplied by x squared, which simplifies to 27 multiplied by x squared. Finally, you have the derivative for 6 multiplied by x, which is simply 6. Now, you will combine these terms by adding or subtracting them accordingly to get a final derivative of f prime of x equal to 14 multiplied by x to the 6th, plus 27 multiplied by x squared minus 6. Now, let's look at an example of a rational derivative. Let's get the derivative of the rational function f of x equals 2, multiplied by x plus 5, divide all of that by x minus 1. You will use the quotient rule to solve this, so you'll have f of x equal to g of x divided by h of x, which in this case, your g of x is equal to 2 multiplied by x plus 5, and h of x is equal to x minus 1. So if you get the derivative of g prime of x, this is just 2, and the derivative of h prime of x is equal to 1. Now you have a quotient rule formula, so you have f prime of x equal to g prime of x multiplied by h of x, minus g of x multiplied by h prime of x, divide all of that by h of x squared. This gets you f prime of x equal to 2 multiplied by x minus 1, then you'll subtract all that by 2 multiplied by x plus five, multiply that by 1. Then, you'll finally divide everything by x minus 1 squared. If you simplify this, you get a final result of f prime of x equal to -7 divided by x minus 1 squared. Let's look at another example of a rational derivative that's a little bit more complicated. Let's have f of x equal to x squared plus 3 multiplied by x, divide all that by x plus 1. So like last time, you'll use your quotient rule with f of x equal to g of x divided by h of x. In this case, your g of x is equal to x squared plus 3 multiplied by x, and your h of x is equal to x plus 1. In this case, g prime of x, using the power rule, is simply 2 multiplied by x plus 3, and then h prime of x is going to be a derivative of 1, just like last time. Now, let's bring up your quotient rule formula of f prime of x equal to g prime of x, multiplied by h of x minus g of x, multiplied by h prime of x, divide all that by h of x squared. Plug in your values to get f prime of x equal to 2 multiplied by x plus 3, multiply that chunk by x plus 1, and then you're going to subtract all of that by x squared plus 3 multiplied by x, and you're going to multiply all of that by 1. Then, you're finally going to divide everything by x plus 1 squared. Once you simplify this, you get a final result of f prime of x equal to x squared plus 2 multiplied by x plus 3, divide all of that by x plus 1 squared. The derivatives of polynomial and rational functions tend to be fairly straightforward once you know the key differentiation rules as you saw in the previous examples. I recommend taking time on your own to practice getting the derivatives of these types of functions. In the next video, I will show you how to work with trigonometric derivatives.

Trigonometric derivatives (5 min 26 seconds)
- [Instructor] Up next are trigonometric derivatives. Trigonometric functions are important through mathematics and calculus, but they can be complicated to understand. This is why I will take some time to review trigonometric derivatives in detail. Before I get into the trigonometric derivatives, let's first review a few key facts about trigonometric functions and their limits. First, the limit as theta approaches zero for sine of theta divided by theta is equal to one. Second, the limit as theta approaches zero of cosine of theta minus one, divided by theta is equal to zero. Both of these limits are gathered by using the Squeeze Theorem, which you learned about previously. Let's use these two limit facts about sine and cosine functions along with the fact that they're both oscillating functions to help gather their derivatives. You can imagine how these two functions interact with each other as they circulate the unit circle, where they tend to rise and fall in a consistent pattern that will be shown in their derivatives. These are the derivatives for the six trigonometric functions. So first, you have F prime of sine of X is equal to cosine of X. Then you have F prime of cosine of X is equal to negative sine of X. Then you have F prime of tangent of X, which is equal to secant squared of X. Then you have F prime of cosecant of X, which is equal to negative cosecant of X, multiplied by cotangent of X. Then you have F prime of secant of X is equal to secant of X multiplied by tangent of X. And finally, F prime of cotangent of X is equal to negative cosecant squared of X. Like I mentioned earlier, the different properties dealing with the sine and cosine functions are key to finding their derivatives. Once you know the derivatives for the sine and cosine functions, you can derive the other four trigonometric function derivatives from there. I highly recommend you memorize these six trigonometric derivatives, since that will be the easiest way to work with them in the long term. Let's look at a few examples of trigonometric derivatives in action. Let's start off by showing how to get the derivative for the tangent function with sine of X divided by cosine of X. So here, you have F of X equals sine of X divided by cosine of X, which as you know, is tangent of X. Using your Quotient Rule, you have F of X equal to G of X divided by H of X. In this case, your G of X is equal to sine of X, and H of X is equal to cosine of X. Let's get the derivatives of these. So you have G prime of X equal to cosine of X, and H prime of X equal to negative sine of X. Now you'll look at your Quotient Rule, so you have F prime of X equal to G prime of X, multiplied by H of X, subtract that by G of X, multiplied by H prime of X, divide all of that by H of X squared. Now let's use the Quotient Rule and the trigonometric derivatives you learned earlier for sine and cosine to plug in these values. So you have F prime of X equal to cosine of X, multiplied by cosine of X, subtracted by sign of X, multiplied by negative sine of X. Divide all that by cosine of X squared. If you simplify the top portion of this, you get F prime of X equal to cosine squared of X, plus sine squared of X is equal to cosine of X squared. Since cosine squared of X plus sine squared of X is equal to one due to the Pythagorean Theorem, this will then get you a result of F prime of X equal to one divided by cosine of X squared. And so here, you see the final result of F prime of X is equal to F prime of tangent of X, which is equal to secant squared of X. Let's look at another example, where this time you have the function F of X equal to five multiplied by secant of X, subtract that by eight, multiplied by cotangent of X, plus X squared. As you see here, you can use the sum and difference rules, the trigonometric derivatives you learned, and the Power Rule to solve this. Let's break this down into smaller pieces. So first, you have F prime of secant of X is equal to secant of X multiplied by tangent of X. Next, you have F prime of cotangent of X equal to negative cosecant squared of X. And finally, you have F prime of X squared is equal to two multiplied by X. Let's bring this back together along with those constant multiples you have to get F prime of X equal to five, multiplied by secant of X, multiplied by tangent of X, subtract that by eight, multiplied by negative cosecant squared of X, and add that with two multiplied by X. If you simplify that middle term, you'll get a final result of F prime of X equal to five, multiplied by secant of X, multiplied by tangent of X, plus eight multiplied by cosecant squared of X, plus two multiplied by X. Like I mentioned before, the best way to learn trigonometric derivatives is to memorize the derivatives for each of the six trigonometric functions. I recommend taking time on your own to practice getting the derivatives of these functions. I also suggest looking at the proofs of how to get these derivatives if you're interested in the behind the scenes of how they work. Up next, I will show you how to work with exponential derivatives.

Exponential derivatives (5 min 57 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next, let's take a look at exponential derivatives. These are derivatives that contain exponents where the variable itself is in the exponent, such as e to the x. This video will not cover functions such as x squared since you could use the power rule to solve those types of functions. Let's begin by looking at general exponential functions in the format of f of x equals a to the x, where a is a real number greater than zero, like I mentioned previously, you cannot use the power rule to solve this function because the variable is in the exponent itself instead of the base. If you wish to get the derivative of a function f of x equals a to the x, then you'll derive it in the following format, so you'll have f prime of x equals the natural log of a multiplied by a to the x. Essentially, this will simplify your function when it's derived to a constant natural logarithmic value multiplied by your original exponential function. Let's look at an example where f of x equals four to the x. Using the format you just looked at. You'll need to gather the natural log of a, which in this case, a equals four, from your function four to the x, and you'll need to multiply that by your original function, four to the x. This then simplifies to get f prime of x equals the natural log of four multiplied by four to the x. Now, let's look at a specific case for exponential derivatives, which is the natural exponential function. So this function is denoted by f of x equals e to the x. If you use the same rule as before, you'll get f prime of x equals the natural log of e multiplied by e to the x. Since the natural log of e equals one, then the derivative is multiplied by one. This means you could simplify your derivative to simply be f prime of x equals e to the x. Let's look at this in an example. Let's say you have the function f of x equals seven multiplied by e to the x. Using what you learned prior with the constant multiple rule, you can ignore the seven and just get the derivative of e to the x, which in this case is just itself, e to the x, where you have f prime of x equals seven multiplied by your derivative, which is e to the x. Now, let's look at a case where you have a function within your function. This will mean your function will be in the form of f of x equals a to the g of x, where g of x is another function. This time, the derivative of your function will be f prime of x equals the natural log of a multiplied by a to the g of x multiplied by g prime of x. Let's dissect this derivative result. So in this case, you still had the same pieces of the derivative like you did before with the natural log of a and your original function a to the g of x. You may be wondering though, why do you also need to multiply this derivative by g prime of x? You need to include this in your derivative result due to the chain rule. This is where you will multiply your outer function derivative, f prime of g of x by the derivative of your inner function, g prime of x. Let's use this in an example. Let's take a look at the function f of x equals two to the x squared plus three, where the x squared plus three is all in the exponent. Here, you'll get your natural log of a, which in this case, is just equal to the natural log of two, and then let's get the derivative of your exponent, which is the function g of x, which is just x squared plus three in this case. So g prime of x is then going to equal two multiplied by x because that plus three is going to cancel out. So let's plug this into your formula of f prime of x equals the natural log of a multiplied by a to the g of x multiplied by g prime of x to get a final derivative result of f prime of x equals the natural log of two multiplied by two to the x squared plus three multiplied by two multiplied by x. Now, let's look at the natural exponent case again, but this time, for having a function within a function. So this time, you have your function f of x equals e to the g of x, where g of x is some sort of other function. The derivative in this case is f prime of x equals e to the g of x multiplied by g prime of x. This is similar to the general exponential function within a function formula. But note that you don't need to add in the natural logarithm at the beginning since like before, since the natural log of e equals one, the derivative is multiplied by one and hence unnecessary to add. Let's take a look at one more example. This time, you have the function f of x equals e to the x cubed plus five multiplied by x, where the x cubed plus five multiplied by x is all in the exponent. This means your g of x equals x cubed plus five multiplied by x, and in this case, you'll want to get the derivative of it where you have g prime of x equals three multiplied by x squared plus five. Let's plug this into your formula of f prime of x equals e to the g of x multiplied by g prime of x. This gets you a final result of f prime of x equals e to the x cubed plus five multiplied by x, and then you'll multiply all of that by three, multiplied by x squared plus five. Knowing how to work with exponential functions, including those containing other functions, will be helpful when you work with more complex derivatives in the future. Up next, you will learn about logarithmic derivatives, where you'll see how they work similarly to exponential derivatives.

Logarithmic derivatives (6 min 53 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now let's explore logarithmic derivatives. These are derivatives that contain logarithms of variables or functions within the logarithms. You will notice how these derivatives function similarly to those of exponents, which makes sense with how they are related to each other. Let's begin by looking at general logarithmic functions in the format, f of x equals log base a of x where x is greater than zero, a is greater than zero, and a is not equal to one. Note that a is some sort of a real number here. As I mentioned previously, you cannot use any of the previous rules to solve this type of function because the variable is within a logarithm. If you wish to get the derivative of a function f of x equals log base a of x, it will then be in the format of f prime of x equals one divided by the natural log of a multiplied by x. Note that the natural log of a multiplied by x is all in the denominator of that fraction. Essentially, this will simplify your derivative to be the inverse of a constant natural logarithmic value multiplied by your original variable x that you found within your logarithmic function. The way you get this derivative is by using what is called the change of base formula. There are many variations of this formula, but the goal is to change the base of your logarithm from some value a to some value b. There are various versions of this formula, such as log base b of x divided by log base b of a, and then there's natural log of x over natural log of a, and finally, log of x over log of a. For these derivatives, you'll be using the change of base formula natural log of x over natural log of A. This is because natural algorithms tend to be the easiest to work with. Let's take a look at an example where f of x equals log base five of x. If you wish to get the derivative of this function, you can then plug in your value for the natural log of a, which in this case will be the natural log of five since that is the base of your natural algorithm, and then plug this into your derivative formula to get f prime of x equals one divided by the natural log of five multiplied by x. Now, let's take a look at the specific case for the natural logarithmic function, f of x equals natural log of x. If you use the same rule as before, you'll get f prime of x equals one divided by a natural log of e multiplied by x. Like you saw with the natural exponential function, since the natural log of e equals one in this case, you will have your derivative multiplied by one. This means you could simplify your derivative to just be f prime of x equals one divided by x. Let's look at this in an example. Let's say you had the function f of x equals nine multiplied by the natural log of x. And in this case, you can ignore the nine since it's a constant multiple that you can bring in after the fact. As you saw previously, the derivative of the natural log of x, it's just one divided by x, so your result of f prime of x equals nine divided by x for your derivative. Now, let's look at the case where you have a function within a function. For logarithms, this will have the function being f of x equals log base a of g of x. In this case, your derivative will be f prime of x equals g prime of x divided by the natural log of a multiplied by g of x. Let's dissect this derivative result. So you still have the same pieces of the derivative that you did before with the natural log of a and the interior part of your logarithm, which in this case is just g of x instead of x. You may be wondering why do you also need to multiply this by g prime of x, which ends up in the numerator of your derivative? Just like with exponential functions within functions, you need to include this in your result due to the chain rule where you multiply your outer function derivative, f prime of g of x by the derivative of your inner function, g prime of x. Let's look at this in action. Let's say you have the function f of x equals log base three of x squared plus 45. First, let's gather the natural logarithm of A, which in this case, is just the natural logarithm of three. In this case, your g of x is equal to x squared plus 45 since that is the interior part of the logarithmic function. Let's get g prime of x in order to find your full derivative, which in this case, is equal to just two multiplied by x because that plus 45 drops off. Let's plug this into your formula of f prime of x equals g prime of x over the natural a of a multiplied by g of x to get you a final derivative result of f prime of x equals two multiplied by x divided by the natural log of three multiplied by x squared plus 45. Finally, let's look at the natural logarithmic case where you have a function within a function. So in this case, you have the function f of x equals the natural log of g of x where the derivative is f prime of x equals g prime of x over g of x. Like before, this is similar to the more generalized logarithmic function, but you do not need to add in the natural log and the denominator since the natural log of e equals one, the derivative will be multiplied by one, meaning that you can just leave it out. Let's look at one more example. Let's have the function f of x equal the natural log of two multiplied by x to the fourth. In this case, your g of x is equal to two multiplied by x to the fourth, and let's get the derivative of that to get g prime of x equals eight multiplied by x cubed. Let's plug this into your formula f prime of x equals g prime of x divided by g of x. Plugging in your values gets you f prime of x equals eight, multiplied by x cubed, divided by two, multiplied by x to the fourth. You can then simplify this to get a final derivative result of f prime of x equals four divided by x. Knowing how to work with logarithmic derivatives, including those containing other functions, will help with more complex derivatives you'll explore in the future. It is also amazing how the change of base formula helps simplify the process of finding these types of derivatives. Next step, let's take a look at inverse derivatives.

Inverse derivatives (5 min 22 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's take a moment to look at derivatives for inverse functions. If you remember from the inverse functions video earlier on in this course, an inverse of a function is essentially the reverse of it. Knowing how to deal with these derivatives will be important in order to help you understand inverse trigonometric derivatives. Let's say you have an inverse function for the function f of x, and it is notated by f to the -1 of x. In order to get the derivative of that inverse function f to the -1 of x, you get f-1 prime of x is equal to 1 divided by f prime of f-1 of x. Note that this only works if your original function f of x is both invertible and differentiable. This formula can be a bit difficult to understand at first with everything feeling like it is flipping around. Essentially, it is saying that derivative of the inverse of your original function f of x is equal to 1 divided by the derivative of your original function f of x evaluated at the specific point of f to the -1 of x. Note that you can prove this formula by using inverse relationships and the chain rule. Let's take a look at a few examples to make more sense of how these derivatives work. Let's have your original function f of x equal to x cubed. The inverse of this function is f to the -1 of x equal to x to the 1/3, also known as the cube root of x. Again, this is because the inverse function essentially undoes what the original function is doing. Let's begin by finding the derivative of your original function f of x equal to x cubed. You can use the power rule to get f prime of x equal to 3 multiplied by x squared. Now you have your derivative formula, so you have f to the -1 prime of x equals 1 divided by f prime of f to the -1 of x, so you have f to the -1 prime of x equal to 1 divided by 3, multiplied by x to the 1/3 squared. If you simplify this, this then gets you a final result of f to the -1 prime of x equal to 1/3 multiplied by x to the -2/3. Let's take a look at another example. Let's say you have the function f of x equal to 2 divided by x plus 7, and you want to find the derivative of the inverse of that function. First, let's gather the inverse of the function itself. So let's change f of x to be y to make this easier to solve. So you'll have y equal to 2 divided by x plus 7. And then you will solve for x. So the way you do this is you move your x over and then you move your y over, and then you subtract 7 from both sides to get x equal to 2 divided by y minus 7 as your result. You can then convert the y back to an x and the x back to a y to keep things consistent in your calculations, where you'll have y equal to 2 divided by x minus 7 to get you an official inverse of f to the -1 of x equals 2 divided by x minus 7. Now that you have the inverse function, you could start by finding the derivative of your original function f of x equals 2 divided by x plus 7 using your quotient rule. Once you do this, you get f prime of x equal to -2 divided by x plus 7 squared. And then let's have your formula f to the -1 prime of x equals 1 divided by f prime of f-1 of x. And plug in your values to get f to the -1 prime of x equals 1 divided by -2 divided by 2 divided by x minus 7 plus 7, and you'll square all of that. Once you simplify that, you get f to the -1 prime of x equals 1 divided by -x squared divided by 2, which gets you a final derivative for your inverse function to be -2 divided by x squared. Note that you can also do inverse derivatives with Euler functions, so again, exponentials and logarithms with the natural log and e to the whatever. So in this case, you have your function f of x equal to e to the x. And as you learned prior, the inverse function of e to the x is simply ln of x, or again, your natural log of x. If you get the derivative of your original function e to the x, you get f prime of x equals e to the x since again, the derivative is itself. Now let's plug this into your formula of f to the -1 prime of x equals 1 divided by f prime of f to the -1 of x, and you get f-1 prime of x equals 1 divided by e to the ln of x. Since the e and the ln cancel out, you get a final result of f to the -1 prime of x equals 1 divided by x. Dealing with inverse derivatives can be a bit tricky at first, but they will get easier with more practice. It's also a good reminder to keep working on learning how to find or memorize inverse functions depending on the case. You'll expand upon what you learned in this video in the next video, where I explain inverse trigonometric derivatives.

Inverse trigonometric derivatives (6 min)
- [Instructor] Now that you learned about trigonometric derivatives and inverse derivatives, let's combine these two topics and learn about inverse trigonometric derivatives. Let's first review the notation for inverse trigonometric functions. If you remember from before, there are two different notations for inverse trigonometric functions. So here you have sine to the negative one of x is equal to arc sine of x. You have cosine to the negative one of x, which is equal to arc cosine of x. Then you have tangent to the negative one of x, which is equal to arc tangent of x. Then you have cosecant to the negative one of x, which is equal to arc cosecant of x. Then you have secant to the negative one of x, which is equal to arc secant of x. And then you'll have cotangent to the negative one of x, which is equal to arc cotangent of x. I will generally refer to these in the arc form such as arc sine or arctan or arc tangent, but note that I will sometimes mix the formats that I show these in equations. Something to know before I show you the six derivatives for the inverse trigonometric functions is that their derivatives are actually algebraic functions. This is different from many cases where the resulting function from the derivative is usually in the same function category as the original function. For example, the derivative of sine is cosine, and again, they're both trigonometric functions, but in this case, that's not the same. This is an excellent case to show that sometimes the derivative of a function does not have to be in the same category as the original function. Let's take a look at the derivatives for the six inverse trigonometric functions. So the way you will often notate a derivative is d over dx, and then you'll have in parentheses the either arc sine or the sine to the negative one of x, and again, for whichever trigonometric function you're looking at. So here we have the derivative for arc sine of x, which is equal to one divided by the square root of one minus x squared. Next, you have the derivative of arc cosine, which is equal to negative one divided by square root of one minus x squared. Then you have the derivative of arc tangent of x, which is equal to one divided by one plus x squared. Next, you have the derivative of arc cosecant of x, which is equal to negative one divided by the absolute value of x multiplied by the square root of x squared minus one. Then you have the derivative of arc secant of x, which is equal to one divided by the absolute value of x multiplied by x squared minus one. And then finally, you have the derivative of arc cotangent of x, which is equal to negative one divided by one plus x squared. You'll notice that these derivatives, like their counterparts of just regular trigonometric derivatives, often have very similar structures throughout since they are very related to each other. These six derivatives can be found and proven by using the inverse function theorem. These then simplify from using the chain rule to get the algebraic derivatives you saw previously. I highly recommend you memorize these six inverse trigonometric derivatives since that will be the easiest way to work with them in the future. Let's look at a few examples of inverse trigonometric derivatives in action. Let's start by showing how to get the derivative of f of x, where the function is equal to six multiplied by arc cotangent of x subtracted by three multiplied by arc cosine of x. Let's split this up. So to get the derivative of arc cotangent of x, it is simply negative one divided by one plus x squared, and then the derivative for arc cosine of x is equal to negative one divided by the square root of one minus x squared. Let's plug these into your derivative to get f prime of x equal to six multiplied by negative one divided by one plus x squared. Subtract that by three multiplied by negative one divided by square root of one minus x squared. If you simplify this, you get a final result of f prime of x equals negative six divided by one plus x squared, and then you'll add three divided by square root of one minus x squared. Let's look at another example where this time you have f of x equal to x squared multiplied by arc sine of x. In this case, you will use your product rule, so you have f of x equals g of x multiplied by h of x. In this case, g of x equals x squared, and h of x equals arc sine of x. If you get your derivatives, you have g prime of x equals two multiplied by x, and then you have h prime of x equals one divided by square root of one minus x squared. Now, let's use your product rule to get f prime of x equals g prime of x multiplied by h of x plus g of x multiplied by h prime of x. This gets you f prime of x equal to two multiplied by x, and then you multiply that by arc sine of x. Then you'll add that by x squared multiplied by one divided by square root of one minus x squared. If you simplify this, you get a final result of two multiplied by x multiplied by sine to the negative one of x plus x squared divided by the square root of one minus x squared. Like I mentioned before, the best way to learn and use inverse trigonometric derivatives is to memorize the derivatives for each of these six functions. I recommend taking time on your own to practice getting the derivatives of these function and making sure you have those six key ones memorized. I also suggest taking a look at the proofs of how to get these derivatives if you are interested in how they work. In the last video of this chapter, I will expand on deriving trigonometric functions by exploring how to work with hyperbolic derivatives.

Hyperbolic derivatives (6 min 13 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up this derivatives chapter by exploring hyperbolic derivatives. Before I get into the derivatives, though, let's first introduce what hyperbolic functions are in the first place. Hyperbolic functions are similar to trigonometric functions, but they're defined using a hyperbola instead of a unit circle. These types of functions are not as common to work with, but it is good to know their derivatives in case they do come up in your future work. Let's first review what the six hyperbolic functions are and what they equal. First, you have sine h of x equal to e to the x minus e to the minus x divided by two. You'll notice the notation has an h on the end, such as, again, sine h instead of just sine to indicate that it is a hyperbolic function. You'll also notice that they have the natural exponent e to the x often used in their functions due to how they relate to exponential contexts. So let's review the other five hyperbolic functions. So you have cosine h of x equal to e to the x plus e to the minus x divided by two. Next, you have tangent h of x is equal to sine h of x divided by cosine h of x, which is e to the x minus e to the minus x divided by e to the x plus e to the minus x. Next, you have cosecant h of x, which is equal to one divided by sine h of x, which is equal to two divided by e to the x minus e to the minus x. Next, you have cosecant h of x, which is equal to one divided by cosine h of x, which is equal to two divided by e to the x plus e to the minus x. And finally, you have cotangent h of x, which is equal to cosine h of x divided by sine h of x, which equals e to the x plus e to the minus x divided by e to the x minus e to the minus x. There are a few hyperbolic function properties you should take note of before we proceed. First, you have f prime of e to the minus x is equal to negative e to the minus x. You'll remember this from earlier, but again, it's something good to keep in mind. Next, you have sine h of negative x is equal to negative sine h of x. Then you have cosine h of negative x is equal to cosine h of x. After that, you have cosine h squared of x minus sine h squared of x is equal to one, and, finally, you have one minus tangent h squared of x is equal to secant h squared of x. Now that you've explored what the hyperbolic functions are and a few of their key properties, now you can find their derivatives. Like with inverse trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions will often be notated with d/dx for the derivatives, and then again, the function itself, for example, sine h of x will be on the inside. So you'll have the derivative of sine h of x is equal to cosine h of x, and then you have the derivative of cosine h of x is equal to sine h of x. Then you have the derivative of tangent h of x is equal to secant h squared of x. Then you have the derivative of cosecant h of x is equal to negative cosecant h of x multiplied by cotangent h of x. Then you have the derivative of cosecant h of x is equal to negative cosecant h of x multiplied by tangent h of x. Finally, you have the derivative of cotangent h of x is equal to cosecant h squared of x. You'll notice these derivatives look very similar to your typical trigonometric derivatives with a few minor changes, and also note that, again, for example, with the derivative of sine h of x equal to cosine h of x, you can then use those previous hyperbolic functions to get the full algebraic version of the function. These six hyperbolic derivatives are found using exponential and hyperbolic properties. I highly recommend you memorize these six hyperbolic derivatives, like with the other trigonometric function derivatives, since that tends to be the easiest way to work with them. Let's look at a few examples of hyperbolic derivatives. First, let's get the derivative for the function f of x equals tangent h of x minus cosine h of x. Like you saw before, the derivative for tangent h of x is equal to secant h squared of x, and the derivative for cosine h of x is equal to sine h of x. Subtract these from each other to get a final result of f prime of x equals secant h squared f x minus sine h of x. Let's look at a little bit more complicated example this time. Let's get the derivative for the function f of x equals four multiplied by x squared multiplied by sine h of x. This time you will want to use the product rule along with the hyperbolic derivative you learned prior. In this case, you'll have f of x equals g of x multiplied by h of x. In this case, your g of x is equal to four multiplied by x squared, and then your h of x is equal to sine h of x. In this case, your g prime of x is equal to eight multiplied by x using the power rule, and your h prime of x is equal to cosine h of x using the derivatives you learned prior. Now, let's combine this with your project rule of f prime of x equals g prime of x multiplied by h of x plus g of x multiplied by h prime of x. This gets you a result of f prime of x equals eight multiplied by x, multiply that by sine h of x, and then you'll add four multiplied by x squared multiplied by cosine h of x. Like I mentioned before, the best way to learn hyperbolic derivatives is to memorize the derivatives for each of these six hyperbolic functions. I recommend taking time on your own to practice getting the derivatives of these functions. Remember, these functions are not as common as the other ones, but they're good to know in case you do encounter them. This wraps up how to work with many common derivatives of various functions. As you saw, it is a mix of learning new techniques using differentiation rules and memorization. Remember, practice is what will help you continue to solidify the knowledge you are learning throughout this course. In the next chapter, you'll explore more complex derivatives such as higher order derivatives and other differentiation techniques.

Day 08
Complex Derivatives
Second-order derivatives (4 min 52 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you will explore more complex derivatives, including higher order derivatives and other differentiation techniques. The other differentiation techniques will include implicit and logarithmic differentiation. Let's start off by exploring higher order derivatives. In the last few chapters, you learned what a derivative is and how to calculate it. So you may be wondering, "What is a higher order derivative?" A higher order derivative is when you take the derivative of a function multiple times. So instead of just deriving a function once, you may derive that original function, then derive the result of that first derivative, and then you repeat that as many times as you need to. Let's start off with exploring second order derivatives. A second order derivative is when you take a derivative two times in succession. Essentially, it is just doing the same thing twice. This is often notated by f double prime x or f to the 2 x where the 2 has parentheses around it. The reason for the second notation is it can become cumbersome to count how many tick marks there are, especially as they grow in number with the higher the order of the derivative is. Second order derivatives have the same properties as regular derivatives do, and they function basically the same, just instead of doing it once, you do it twice. It is important to note that second order derivatives measure acceleration. Hence, this is why they are often referred to as acceleration. In fields such as physics, the derivative is often represented with respect to time, t as d squared of x divided by dt squared. Note, that again, this is another way to notate that second order derivative. Let's look at a few examples of how second order derivatives work. Let's first look at the function f of x equal to 3 multiplied by x cubed plus 2 multiplied by x plus 7. Let's start off by getting the first derivative, so you have f prime of x equal to 9 multiplied by x squared plus 2. Now you're going to get the derivative again, so this time you're getting the derivative of 9 multiplied by x squared plus 2. So again, using the rules that you learned previously, the second derivative f double prime x will equal 18 multiplied by x. Something you'll notice as you continue to take more and more derivatives is you sometimes slowly lose more information about the original function over time. In the last example, you ended up losing the last two pieces of the original function, 2 multiplied by x plus 7, because they got zeroed out with the derivatives. This is something to keep in mind for future content. Let's look at another example of a second order derivative. So this time you have f of x equal to 4 multiplied by x multiplied by e to the x. Let's get the first order derivatives, so you have f prime of x equal to 4 multiplied by e to the x. Add that with 4 multiplied by x multiplied by e to the x. Again, the way you get this is using the previous rules you learned, along with working with exponential functions, such as e to the x. Now, to get the second order derivative, you're going to derive the result you got in that first derivative. So f double prime of x is equal to 4 multiplied bye to the x plus 4 multiplied by x multiplied by e to the x plus 4 multiplied by e to the x. You can simplify this result to simply be e to the x and multiply that by 8 plus 4 multiplied by x. You'll notice that some examples like this one will solely multiply in how many terms they have as the order of the derivative increases. So as you can tell, it just gets longer and longer the more derivatives you take. Why would you need to take a second order derivative in the first place? Like mentioned earlier, these derivatives are important in physics to measure acceleration when designing rollercoasters to ensure they have enough acceleration to have a fun but safe ride. In economics, they're used to help companies determine whether increasing their production will increase their profit or not. In business, companies can use them to determine the optimal pricing for the products they are selling. Once you understand the concept of second order derivatives, any derivatives higher than that are fairly straightforward with the simple repetition of the process. I suggest taking a moment to feel comfortable with the concept of second order derivatives in order to feel confident as you continue to take more of them. Up next, you'll continue to expand upon this concept with third order derivatives.

Third-order derivatives (4 min 58 seconds)
- [Instructor] Once you have learned the concept of second-order derivatives, any derivatives with a higher order than that are fairly easy to learn. Essentially, you just keep repeating the same process as many times as needed. In this video, you'll explore third-order derivatives. A third-order derivative is when you take a derivative three times in succession. Essentially, it is doing the same thing three times in a row. It is often notated by f triple prime x or f to the 3 of x. And again, note that the 3 is usually in parentheses. Remember, the second notation is needed because it can become cumbersome to count how many tick marks there are, as you can tell already, even just with three of them. Like with second-order derivatives, third-order derivatives have the same properties as regular first-order derivatives do. It is important to note that third-order derivatives measure the rate of change of acceleration. These derivatives are often referred to as jerk or jolt. In fields such as physics, the derivative is often represented by d to the 3 of x divided by dt to the 3. And again, that is with respect to time, t. And like before, this is another way that you can notate a third-order derivative. Let's look at a few examples of how third-order derivatives work. Let's first look at the function f of x equal to 4 multiplied by x to the 5th plus 7 multiplied by x cubed plus 9 multiplied by x plus 1. Let's get the first derivative using the rules that you learned before. So you have f prime of x equal to 20 multiplied by x to the 4th plus 21 multiplied by x squared plus 9. Now let's get the second-order derivative. So you have f double prime of x equal to 80 multiplied by x to the 3 plus 42 multiplied by x. Finally, you'll get your third-order derivative. So again, one more time. We have f triple prime of x equal to 240 multiplied by x squared plus 42. Like you noticed before, the more derivatives you take, the more information you will tend to lose over time for many functions that you take derivatives of. In the previous example, you ended up losing the last two pieces of the original function 9 multiplied by x plus 1. This is because they got zeroed out with the derivatives you were taking. Again, something to keep in mind for future content. Let's look at another example, but this time, let's have f of x equal to 5 to the x. Let's get the first derivative f prime of x. And this equals to the natural log of 5 multiplied by five to the x. Remember, you get this from what you learned in the exponential derivatives video. Let's get the next derivative of this. So here you have f double prime of x equal to natural log of 5 multiplied by natural log of 5 multiplied by 5 to the x. You can simplify this to the natural log of 5 squared multiplied by 5 to the x. Reason why the natural log of 5 shows up twice is the first derivative you have the natural log of 5 multiplied by 5 to the x. You essentially treat that natural log of 5 as just a constant. And again, you basically just keep getting that derivative over and over. Let's do this one more time to get f triple prime of x. And this equals natural log of 5 cubed multiplied by 5 to the x. You'll notice that some examples like this one tend to look very similar with each derivative, where the first derivative just seems to slowly grow over time, or it keeps the main function intact throughout the different iterations. So for example, with this one, 5 to the x still stays consistent through all the derivatives, but your natural log of 5 just slowly grows in number. Why would you need to take a third-order derivative in the first place? Like I mentioned earlier, these derivatives are important in physics to measure the rate of change of acceleration. For example, when manufacturing, how fast or slow to move elevators up and down. They can be used in robotics to ensure robotic arms in an assembly line move in a smooth enough fashion in order to do their job correctly. They are also used in other fields, such as economics, to measure any changes in acceleration of economic growth or decline. In biology, they're also used to measure how rapidly population growth or decline is changing. Like I mentioned before, once you understand the concept of second-order derivatives, any derivatives higher than that are fairly straightforward with, again, the simple repetition of the process. Up next, you'll continue to expand upon this concept with fourth-order derivatives.

Fourth-order derivatives (4 min 32 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's continue with exploring higher-order derivatives by taking a look at fourth-order derivatives. Like I mentioned before, once you know how to do one derivative, then you know how to do higher-order derivatives, since it is just doing the same thing over and over. Let's get started by looking at a definition. A fourth-order derivative is when you take a derivative four times in succession. Essentially, it is doing the same thing four times in a row. It is often notated by F with four prime symbols of X, or F to the fourth of X. Again, know that the second notation with the F and the parentheses four of X is often used especially for fourth-order derivatives because four prime symbols is a lot to count. Like the second-order and third-order derivatives, fourth-order derivatives have the same properties as regular first-order derivatives do. It is important to note that fourth-order derivatives measure the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time. These derivatives are often referred to as snap or jounce. They're often used to measure curvature, smoothness, and stability. In fields such as physics, the derivative with respect to time T is often notated by D to the fourth of X divided by DT to the fourth. Again, like before, this is another way that you can notate your fourth-order derivative is this type of notation. Let's look at a few examples of how fourth-order derivatives work. Let's look at the function F of X equal to two multiplied by X to the sixth plus three multiplied by X to the fifth plus eight multiplied by X squared plus 10. So in this example, you're simply just going to take the derivative four different times. So let's start with F prime of X equals 12 multiplied by X to the fifth plus 15 multiplied by X to the fourth plus 16 multiplied by X. Next, your second-order derivative is F double prime X is equal to 60 multiplied by X to the fourth plus 60 multiplied by X to the third plus 16. Let's do it again with the third-order derivative. So you have F to the three of X is 240 multiplied by X to the third plus 180 multiplied by X squared. Finally, you get to your fourth-order derivative, so you have F to the fourth of X is equal to 720 multiplied by X squared plus 360 multiplied by X. Let's look at another example, but this time, let's look at the trigonometric function F of X equals sine of X. In this case, you'll have your first derivative, F prime of X equals cosine of X. Then you'll have F double prime X equal to negative sine of X. Now you have your third-order derivative, F to the three of X, which is equal to negative cosine X. Finally, you have your fourth-order derivative, F to the fourth X, which is equal sine of X. You'll notice in the previous example how the fourth derivative of your function F of X is actually equal to your original function. This is because some functions, such as the sine and cosine trigonometric functions, have cyclical patterns where they will slowly cycle through and repeat their derivatives. So essentially, no matter how many derivatives you take, you will only get one of the four results shown in the previous example for the derivatives of sine of X. Note that this process is basically the same for cosine of X, except it just starts in a different spot. So why would you need to take a fourth-order derivative in the first place? Like I mentioned earlier, these derivatives are important in physics to measure snap, for example, to help create smooth paths for airplanes, rockets, and cars. In civil engineering, the snap is often used when designing bridges to ensure they can withstand varying loads being on them without breaking. And finally, in audio and image processing, these types of derivatives are used in algorithms to help create smoother and cleaner signals or visuals. Now that you know how to do second, third, and fourth-order derivatives, you know how to do any derivatives higher than four as well. You just keep taking as many derivatives as you need. In the next video, I will pivot topics a bit to discuss a key differentiation technique called implicit differentiation.

Implicit differentiation (6 min 58 seconds)
 - [Instructor] So far, you have used standard differentiation techniques. There are some cases, though, where standard differentiation will not suffice. This is where implicit differentiation and logarithmic differentiation come in handy. Let's start off by exploring implicit differentiation. There are some cases where the equation you are taking a derivative of is not in the standard format y equals f of x. There are also sometimes cases where the dependent variable, such as y, is not isolated to one side of the equation. For example, if you have y equal to x squared plus four multiplied by y cubed. This makes it difficult to solve for your dependent variable y explicitly, and it frequently arises in equations for relations that define shapes or curves, like circles and hyperbolas. This is where implicit differentiation comes in handy. Implicit differentiation is the process where you are differentiating equations where the dependent variable y is not isolated on one side of the equation. In this process, you differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x by treating y as a function of x. Note, the chain rule is heavily used in this process since y greatly depends on x. Let's review the steps to conduct implicit differentiation. The three steps are, step one, differentiate both sides of your equation implicitly with respect to x. You'll use the chain rule where you have your dependent variable to get d over dx multiplied by y is equal to dy over dx. Step two, you'll simplify the equation by collecting all the dy/dx terms on one side of the equation. And finally, step three, you'll solve for your derivative dy/dx by isolating it to find the derivative of y with respect to x. Let's take a look at this technique in action with a few examples. Let's look at the equation of a circle x squared plus y squared equals 25. As you could tell, y is not isolated on one side of this equation. Your first step is to differentiate both sides of the equation implicitly with respect to x. So the way you do this is you have d over dx multiplied by x squared plus d over dx multiplied by y squared is equal to d over dx multiplied by 25. Now you'll differentiate each piece of the equation, so the derivative of x squared with respect to x is two multiplied by x. Next, you have the derivative d of dx for y squared. And remember, this is actually with respect to x, so you'll need to use the chain rule to get a result of two multiplied by y multiplied by dy/dx. And finally, the derivative of 25, since it is a constant, is just zero. Now you're ready for step two. This time you will want to isolate dy/dx by first subtracting both sides of the equation by 2x. So this will get you two multiplied by y multiplied by dy/dx is equal to negative two multiplied by x. Then you'll divide both sides of the equation by 2y to get dy over dx equal to negative two multiplied by x, divided by two multiplied by y. Finally, you can simplify this a little bit more to simply get dy over dx is equal to negative x over y. Since you only have one dy/dx term, you have already accomplished step three, meaning your final result is dy over dx equals the negative x over y. Let's look at another example where this time you want to differentiate the equation x cubed plus y cubed equals sine of x plus sine of y. Your first step is to differentiate both sides of the equation implicitly with respect to x. So this gets you d over dx multiplied by x cubed plus d over dx multiplied by y cubed is equal to d over dx multiplied by sine of x plus d over dx multiplied by sine y. Now let's take the derivatives of the different parts of this equation. So for the first part, for d of dx x cubed, you simply use the power rule to get three multiplied by x squared. The next part is d over dx multiplied by y cubed, which again, this time you will use the chain rule and the power rule to get three multiplied by y squared multiplied by dy over dx. Next, you have your derivative of d of dx sine of x, which, as you know, is simply cosine of x. And then finally, you need to use the chain rule one more time for the derivative d of dx of sine y to get cosine of y multiplied by dy/dx. This gets you the final result of three multiplied by x squared plus three multiplied by y squared multiplied by dy/dx is equal to cosine of x plus cosine of y multiplied by dy/dx. With step two, you'll want to isolate dy/dx by putting all the dy/dx terms on the left side of the equation. So if you do this, you get three multiplied by y squared multiplied by dy/dx subtracted by cosine of y multiplied by dy/dx, and this is equal to cosine of x subtracted by three multiplied by x squared. With step three, you will solve for your derivative dy/dx by isolating it to find the derivative of y with respect to x. Since both of your terms on the left side had the dy/dx, you can then put them in parentheses like so, where you have dy/dx multiplied by three multiplied by y squared minus cosine of y. And again, that is still equal to cosine of x subtracted by three multiplied by x squared. You'll then divide both sides by your three multiplied by y squared minus cosine of y to get a final result of dy/dx equals cosine of x minus three multiplied by x squared. Divide all of that by three multiplied by y squared minus cosine of y. There are various applications for using implicit differentiation. In economics, it can be used to find derivatives in systems of equations with interdependent variables. In engineering, it can be used to analyze curves and surfaces where y is indirectly related to x. And finally, in physics, it can be used to model rates of change like shadow length. The implicit differentiation method helps open the possibilities to drive equations that are not in the standard format and saves you time in the process of taking those derivatives, I suggest practicing with more equations using implicit differentiation on your own. Up next, you'll learn about another differentiation technique, logarithmic differentiation.

Logarithmic differentiation (8 min 5 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up by exploring another differentiation technique. In this video, you will learn what logarithmic differentiation is, how it works with implicit differentiation, and how to calculate derivatives using this method. There are some cases where taking the derivative of a function is too complicated using the traditional techniques you have learned so far, for example, if the derivative is a product of multiple functions, a complex quotient, or a function with variable bases and exponents. This is when a technique like logarithmic differentiation can be useful. Logarithmic differentiation is the process when you simplify a derivative using logarithms. In this process, you take the natural logarithm of both sides of the function, and then apply implicit differentiation. This helps you utilize the properties of logarithms to help break down your function into simpler terms to solve. So what are the steps to conduct logarithmic differentiation? The four steps are step one, you take the natural logarithm of both sides of your equation. So let's say you have y equals f of x. You would then take the natural log to get ln of y equals ln of f of x. So again, the natural log on both sides. Step two is you simplify your now logarithmic expression using logarithmic properties. Step three, you differentiate both sides of the equation implicitly with respect to x. And finally, step four, you solve for your derivative by isolating it to one side of the equation. There are three common logarithmic properties you can use to simplify your equation. The first one is the natural log of a multiplied by b is equal to the natural log of a plus the natural log of b. Next, if you have the natural log of a divided by b, this is equal to the natural log of a minus the natural log of b. And finally, if you have the natural log of a to the n, where n is some sort of constant value, that is then equal to n multiplied by the natural log of a. Let's take a look at using logarithmic differentiation with a few examples. Let's say you have the function y equals x to the x. This is a case where the derivative is a function with variable bases and exponents. Your first step is to take the natural logarithm of both sides to get the natural log of y equals the natural log of x to the x. In this case, you can use that property of the natural log of a to the n equals n multiplied by the natural log of a. So this simplifies your equation to be the natural log of y equals x multiplied by the natural log of x in order to complete step two to simplify your equation. Now this looks like an equation that you can derive. So for step three, you'll want to derive this equation implicitly with respect to x. Using the chain rule since y is a function of x on the left side, you'll get d, dx multiplied by the natural log of y equals one divided by y multiplied by y prime. Using the product rule on the right side, you can get one multiplied by the natural log of x plus x multiplied by one divided by x, which is equal to the natural log of x plus one. Finally, let's isolate y prime. So currently, you have one over y multiplied by y prime equal to the natural log of x plus one. So you can then move the y by multiplying it on both sides to get y prime equal to y multiplied by the natural log of x plus one. If you remember from earlier, your function y was equal to x to the x, so you could substitute this in to get a final derivative of y prime equals x to the x multiplied by the natural log of x plus one. Let's look at another example where this time, you want to differentiate the function y equals x squared multiplied by the square root of x plus one. This is the case where the derivative is a product of multiple functions. So your first step is to take the natural logarithm of both sides to get the natural log of y equals the natural log of x squared multiplied by the square root of x plus one. Step two, you can use the first logarithmic property mentioned earlier, which is the natural log of a multiplied by b equals the natural log of a plus the natural log of b. So this simplifies your equation to be the natural log of y equals the natural log of x squared plus the natural log of the square root of x plus one. This equation is still a little complicated to solve, so let's use another logarithmic property. This time, let's use the property of natural log of a to the n equals n multiplied by the natural log of a. So you can use this with your equation to get the natural log of x squared plus the natural log of the square root of x plus one equals two multiplied by the natural log of x plus 1/2 multiplied by the natural log of x plus one. For step three, you will want to derive this equation implicitly with respect to x. Using the chain rule since y is a function of x on the left side, like last time, you get d over dx multiplied by the natural log of y equals one divided by y multiplied by y prime. So let's look at the right side of your equation where you have the derivative d, dx of two multiplied by the natural log of x plus d, dx multiplied by 1/2 multiplied by the natural log of x plus one. And so the first portion is simply going to be two multiplied by the derivative of natural log of x, which is just one over x. So this gets you two over x, and then your second portion is going to be the derivative of the natural log of x plus one, which is one divided by x plus one. And then using the chain rule, you'll then multiply that to get one divided by two multiplied by x plus one. So now you have the equation one divided by y multiplied by y prime equals two divided by x plus one divided by two multiplied by x plus one. If you isolate just y prime to the left side of the equation, you multiply both sides by y to get y prime equals two divided by x plus one divided by two multiplied by x plus one, and you multiply all of that by y. If you use the information you had initially where y is equal to x squared multiplied by the square root of x plus one, you can then plug that in to get y prime equals two divided by x plus one divided by two multiplied by x plus one, and then you'll multiply that by x squared multiplied by the square root of x plus one. You can simplify this a bit to get a final result of y prime equals two multiplied by x multiplied by the square root of x plus one plus x squared divided by two multiplied by the square root of x plus one. There are various applications for using logarithmic differentiation. In engineering, it can be used in rate of change problems. In physics, it can be used for growth models and power law relationships. In economics, it can be used in elasticity and demand functions that contain exponents. This derivation method seems a bit convoluted at first, but as you saw from the few examples, it has some great advantages to really simplify the derivation process once you take those natural logs. It is also great seeing how you can use the power of logarithms to your advantage when deriving functions. This wraps up complex derivatives. It is important to understand how to take higher-order derivatives along with using two more advanced integration techniques. These will all be very useful when working with more complex functions in the future. I suggest take your time on your own to continue exploring the techniques you learned. In the next chapter, I will introduce you to some common derivative applications.

Derivate Applications
Related rates (6 min 13 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you'll explore multiple applications for derivatives. This includes approximations, theorems, optimization problems, and more. Let's start off by exploring related rates. Suppose you have two related variables that both change with time. For example, how volume is related to the radius of a sphere as it expands. A related rates problem is where you know how one of the rates change at a given instant for a variable, and then you use this to find the rate the other variable is changing at that same instant. changing at that same instant. Let's read the steps to solve a related rates problem. Step one, you'll want to define your two variables. Step two, determine an equation Step three, using the chain rule you will take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to the independent variable. Step four, substitute all known values at that instant into the equation. And step five, solve for the unknown rate of change. Let's use this process with a few related rates problems. Let's begin by looking at a problem where you inflate a spherical sports ball at a rate of five inches cubed per second. Let's determine how fast the radius is increasing when the radius is at six inches. Let's start off by defining your variables. So in this case, you'll have your variables of radius, r, and volume, capital V. In this case, you know, dv/dt, which is the rate that the volume is inflating at. And you need to find dr/dt, as in how fast is that radius increasing. You can relate these two variables by using the sphere volume equation, V equal to four thirds multiplied by pi, multiplied by r cubed. Now for step three, you will use the chain rule and take the derivative on both sides of the equation, which will be with respect to t, for time. So this gives you dv/dt on the left side since it was just the variable V. And then on the right side, you'll have four thirds multiplied by pi, multiplied by three, multiplied by r squared, multiplied by dr/dt. So if you simplify this on the right, you get dv/dt equals four multiplied by pi, multiplied by r squared, multiplied by dr/dt. In this case, you know, dv/dt equals five inches cubed per second and r equals six. So let's plug these into your equation for dv/dt and r to get five equal to four multiplied by pi, multiplied by six squared, multiplied by dr/dt. This simplifies to five equal to 144 multiplied by pi, multiplied by dr/dt. This means dr/dt equals five divided by 144 multiplied by pi, which is approximately equal to 0.011. So what this represents is the rate of change for your radius at that particular time. Let's look at another related rates problem. This time you have an airplane flying over an airport at a constant elevation of 10,000 meters. There is a delivery hub and an air traffic control tower spaced 1,000 meters apart on the ground. The airplane is currently flying horizontally away from the air traffic control tower. If the plane is flying at a rate of 250 meters per second, then what is the rate the distance between the air traffic control tower and the airplane increasing when the plane passes over the delivery hub? So this is another great instance of using related rates to solve. First, let's define the two variables for your problem, which in this case you have the distance between the air traffic control tower and the delivery hub, and you can have this be x, and then you can have the distance between the air traffic control tower and the airplane, which in this case you could have it be y. So in this case, you know dx/dt, but you need to find dy/dt. Next, let's relate these two variables. And in this case, you can use Pythagorean's theorem to relate your variables x and y since this problem makes a triangle. So this gets you an equation such as y f of t squared equals x of t squared plus 10,000 squared. Now for step three, you will use the chain rule to take the derivative on both sides of the equation, which will be with respect to t for time. So you have your equation y of t squared equals x of t squared plus 10,000 squared, and this derives to dy/dt multiplied by y is equal to dx/dt multiplied by x. You technically have a two on both sides, but you can cancel those out. Now you could substitute in your known values, which would be dx/dt equal to 250 and x equal to 1,000. So let's plug these into your equation where you have y of t squared equals 1,000 squared plus 10,000 squared, which means y is approximately 10,050. Now that you have y, you can then plug this into your derivative where you have dy/dt multiplied by 10,050, which equals 250 multiplied by 1,000. Solve this for dy/dt to get dy/dt equal to 250, multiplied by 1,000, divided by 10,050. And this is approximately equal to 24.88. This means you have solved for your unknown rate of change for your distance increasing between the air traffic control tower and the airplane, which now you know is approximately 24.88. Related rates help you work with related quantities as they change over time. I highly recommend taking time on your own to continue practicing more problems with related rates. Up next, you'll explore linear approximations.

Linear approximations (6 min 37 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this video, you'll explore linear approximations. You'll see how these approximations are closely related with derivatives. Let's start with the definition. Linear approximations are when you use a tangent line to make an approximation of a value, a. For example, if you wish to approximate the value of the square root of 9.02, you can use this method to do so. This method is helpful when you are estimating values a that are close to a defined x. In order to do a linear approximation, you need to know the equation of a tangent line. You can find a tangent line where x is equal to a value a for a function of x. The tangent line is represented by capital L of x equals f of a plus f prime of a multiplied by x minus a. As you could tell, you'll need a derivative in order to complete this equation. Let's go through a few examples. Let's say you have the function f of x equals the square root of x, and let's say you'll choose the value a equals 16 to estimate the value of the square root of 16.2. Let's plug this into your equation, Capital L of x equals f of a plus f prime of a multiplied by x minus a, which gets you capital L of x equals F of 16 plus f prime of 16 multiplied by x minus 16. Once you solve this and plug in your different values, you'll need to get f of 16, which simply equals your function square root of x, which is square root of 16, which just equals four. Next, you'll need to get the derivative at 16. So first, to get f prime of x, you'll use the power rule to get one half multiplied by x to the negative one half. Plugging in your value of 16, you'll get f prime of 16 equals one half multiplied by 16 to the negative one half. Once you simplify this, you'll get f prime of 16 equals one divided by eight. So this gets you the linear approximation equation of capital L of x equals four plus one eighth multiplied by x minus 16, and so this will be representing your tangent line at a equals four. Now that you have your equation, let's estimate where x is equal to 16.2. Let's plug this into your equation to get capital L of 16.2 equals four plus one eighth multiplied by 16.2 minus 16. This means capital L of 16.2 is equal to 4.025. If you plug in the square root of 16.2 into a calculator, you would get approximately 4.0249, which is rounded and is super close to your linear approximation you just discovered. A fun fact is your calculator actually uses approximations, but it is just at a much higher degree to get a more accurate result with more decimal places. Something else to keep in mind is this type of approximation only works for values of a that are close to x. So let's try and estimate where x equals 25 with the equation you just found. So you'll have capital L of 25 equals four plus one eighth multiplied by 25 minus 16. Simplifying this, you get capital L of 25 equals 6.375. As you know, the square root of 25 is equal to five, so you could tell it is not a very good estimate. Because again, the value you picked for this is too far away. This is why you need to ensure you choose an x that is nearby your a in order to properly estimate it. Let's look at an example using a trigonometric function. Let's have f of x equal sine of x where you have a equal to pi divided by three, which is equal to 60 degrees. And let's say you want to estimate where sine of x has x at 58 degrees. 60 degrees should be close enough. So let's get your linear approximation equation going. So you'll have capital L of x equals f of a plus f prime of a multiplied by x minus a, which plugging in, your A equals pi divided by three. You'll get capital L of x equals f of pi divided by three plus f prime of pi divided by three, multiplied by x minus pi divided by three. So using your equation, you'll need to find f of pi divided by three, f prime of pi divided by three in order to solve this equation. So for f pi divided by three, this will equal sine of pi divided by three, which is equal to the square root of three divided by two. Now let's get the derivative of your function, which the derivative of sine is cosine. So f prime of x equals cosine of x. So if you plug in f prime of pi divided by three, you'll get that equal to cosine of pi divided by three, which means that f prime of pi divided by three is equal to one half. Plugging this gets your linear approximation equation of capital L of x equals square root three divided by two plus one half multiplied by x minus pi divided by three. Now that you have your equation, let's estimate where x is equal to 58 degrees. First, you will convert your degrees into radians, where you'll have x equal 58 multiplied by pi divided by 180. Plugging this into your equation, you get capital L of 58, multiplied by pi divided by 180 is equal to the square root of three divided by two plus one half multiplied by 58, multiplied by pi minus 180 minus pi divided by three. This means your linear approximation at 58 degrees where you have capital L of 58 multiplied by pi divided by 180 is equal to 0.848. Again, if you plug this into a calculator for 58 degrees, you'll get a result of 0.849, which is super close to your linear approximation. Linear approximations can be helpful to simplify more complex functions such as motion and force at a defined point, along with helping you estimate values. It is also a foundational concept utilized in more complex topics such as Taylor Series. Up next, let's explore differentials.

Differentials (4 min 12 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next up, let's explore differentials. Now, you may be wondering, aren't differentials the same things as derivatives? They actually are not the same thing, but they are closely related to derivatives and linear approximations. Differentials help you estimate the amount a function changes for a small change in input values. The differential represents the linear approximation of the change in the function based on the change in the input. This is different from a derivative that measures the rate of change of the function and gives you the tangent line slope. When it comes to notating differentials, you'll notice they are very similar to how you denote derivatives. If you remember, with derivatives, they sometimes take the form dy over dx as equal to f prime of x. If you separate out the dy and dx, these are what are called the differentials. So, dy is a differential and then dx is a differential. So, if you move this function around where you have y equal to f of x, then your differential dy is defined by the function dy equal to f prime of x dx. This means your function f of x has a differential dy that is a linear approximation of the change in your function based on the change of your input dx in x. Note that dy is a function of both x and dx. Plus, x needs to be any non-zero real number in order for this function to work. Let's start off by looking at how you get a differential in the first place. Let's say you have the function y equals sine of x. In order to get the differential, you need to use your function dy equal to f prime of x dx. As you calculated prior, the derivative of f prime of sine of x is equal to cosine of x. If you plug this into your formula, you then get dy equal to cosine of x dx. Notice that this function is similar to getting the derivative of sine of x where you have f prime of sine of x is equal to dy over dx, which is equal to cosine of x. But this time, you're defining the differential dy instead of the full derivative dy over dx. Let's expand upon this example. Let's say you have x equal to five and dx equal to 0.2 to represent your change. You can then plug these values into your equation dy equal to cosine of x dx to get dy equal to cosine of 5 multiplied by 0.2. This simplifies to approximately 0.1992 for your differential dy. Let's look at another example. Let's say your function is y equal to x cubed plus 4 multiplied by x. This time, you want to compute the change from x equals 6 to x equals 6.1. In this case, that means your dx or your difference is going to be equal to 0.1, since if you subtract 6.1 by 6, you get 0.1. The derivative of x cubed plus 4 multiplied by x is simply 3 multiplied by x squared, plus 4 using the power rule. And then, if you plug this into your equation, you get dy equal to 3 multiplied by x squared plus 4dx. And let's plug in your values of 6 and .1 to get dy equal to 3 multiplied by 6 squared plus 4, and multiply all of that by 0.1. This gets you a result for your differential dy equal to 32.8. The goal of this application is to show you a new perspective on understanding what goes on behind derivatives with their differentials. I suggest take your time on your own to continue exploring how linear approximations and differentials are related. Up next, let's explore some extreme values such as minimum and maximum values.

Extreme Values (9 min 12 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this video, you will explore extreme values, including minimum and maximum values. Before you dive into finding these values with derivatives, let's take a moment to learn some key facts about extreme values also known as extremum. Let's take a moment to look at a graph to visually see extreme values. If you look at the graph, you'll notice there are multiple peaks and valleys. These are what are called extreme values. so if you look around x equals negative two, you'll see there is a high point that is somewhere between the values of y equals three and four. That is going to be a maximum value because it is a peak. Then if you look at x equals approximately negative 0.5, you'll see there is a valley that is a little bit below y equals negative one. That is what is called a minimum value. So as you could tell with this graph, you have multiple peaks, which are different maximum values and multiple valleys, which are minimum values. You'll also note the function goes straight up around x equals two and straight down where x equals negative two, and so that is where you will start to get to your bigger minimum and maximum values. Now that you've visually seen some extreme values, let's formally define them. First, you have your local or relative extreme values. A function f of x has a local minimum value, where x equals c and f of x is greater than or equal to f of c for every x in an open interval. And then on the flip side, a function, f of x, has a local maximum value where x equals c and f of x is less than or equal to f of c for every x in an open interval. Note that this interval does not have to be the full interval for the entire function, that it can just be for part of the function f of x. Next up are absolute or also known as global extreme values. A function f of x has an absolute minimum value where x equals c and f of x is greater than or equal to f of c for every x in the full interval of the function f of x. On the flip side, a function, f of x, has an absolute maximum value where x equals c and f of x is less than or equal to f of c for every x in the full interval of the function f of x. Note that this must be for all values of the function f of x. Now that you've learned about local and absolute extreme values, let's look at a few key facts about these two. Note that all absolute extreme values are local extreme values, but this does not work the other way around because not all local extreme values are absolute extreme values. This is because the absolute extreme value is for the entire function, versus the local extreme values focus on a particular interval within the function. From this, it is clear that you can then have multiple local extreme values, but you can only have one absolute minimum and one absolute maximum value. Now that you've defined what extreme values are, let's take a look at the extreme value theorem. The extreme value theorem states that for a continuous function, f of x, on an interval that is closed and bounded from a to b, there is an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum for the function f of x. This theorem is fairly logical since it is stating you will always need to have an absolute lowest and an absolute highest value with your function. Next, let's define what a critical point is. Let the value c be a point on the domain of function f of x. The value c is a critical point for function f of x if f prime of c equals zero, or f prime of c is undefined. Now you could see where the derivatives start to become very useful. Critical points will be very important for when you start exploring the following theorem. Expanding upon critical points and the relation to extreme values, you get Fermat's theorem. Fermat's theorem states if your function f of x has a local extreme value at a value c and f of x is differentiable at c, then f prime of c equals zero. So what this is saying is if you have extreme values with a derivative of zero, then the tangent line is at the top or bottom of a curve. Since that tangent line will then be a horizontal line, it will then have a zero slope causing the derivative to be zero. A few quick notes regarding Fermat's theorem. One is that this theorem only works where the derivative is defined, so it does not include extreme values where the derivative is undefined. Also, note that this theorem does not work the other way around where a derivative of zero implies a local extreme value. This is because you can have a derivative of zero that does not have any sort of extreme value associated with it. Let's look at an example of that. Let's say you have the function f of x equals x cubed, which is represented by the graph of this blue line where it's going up from the bottom left and then kind of levels out around x equals zero and then it goes back up fairly quickly. At this case, at the point x equals zero, you would have a derivative of zero because it would have that horizontal line creating a zero slope. But as you could tell from this graph, there is no extreme value here since this happens right in the middle of where this function is essentially flattening out and then continuing to go up in the same direction. Let's find some local extreme values using derivatives. Let's say you have the function f of x equals 1/3 multiplied by x cubed minus seven halves multiplied by x squared plus six multiplied by x. If you piece this out, you can get a derivative of f prime of x equals x squared minus seven multiplied by x plus six. If you factor this, you'll get f prime of x equals x minus six and x minus one. This means that your derivative f prime of x will equal zero at the points x equals six and x equals one. This will then make both of these extreme values. Let's validate your findings in this graph. So this is the graph of your function f of x equals 1/3 multiplied by x cubed minus seven halves multiplied by x squared plus six multiplied by x represented by the blue line. So you notice the blue line is going up pretty quickly on the slightly negative x side, and then it has that little peak at that x equals one, so that is one of your values, and then it quickly goes back down to where x equals six where it has a valley, and then it proceeds to go up very rapidly. Let's look at another example of this. Let's say you have the function f of x equals four multiplied by x divided by one plus x squared. You can get the derivative of this function using the quotient rule. So you'll have f prime of x equals one plus x squared multiplied by four subtracted by four multiplied by x multiplied by two multiplied by x. This will all be divided by one plus x squared, and then you'll square that. If you simplify the top portion of your fraction, you'll get f prime of x equals four minus four multiplied by x squared divided by one plus x squared, and again, that is also squared. As you may notice, the bottom portion of this equation will always be positive with x squared, and the one to be added to it will ensure it will never equal zero. This leaves the top portion to dissect for when the derivative equals zero. So you could get rid of the denominator to focus on just the numerator where you have four minus four multiplied by x squared equals zero. So here you get four equals four multiplied by x squared. Divide both sides by four to get one equals x squared, so you have x equals plus or minus one. So this means your derivative, f prime of x, equals zero at the values of x equals one and x equals two. You can validate your findings again on a graph, so this is your graph of f of x equals four multiplied by x divided by one plus x squared where it's represented by the blue line. So you'll see it's coming in from the left, and at that point x equals negative one, you'll see it has a little valley, and then it goes up fairly quickly to where x equals one, where it has a bit of a peak, and then it starts to slowly decrease from there. So you could tell you did find the correct local minimum and local maximum values. There's a lot to explore when it comes extreme values, but this should give you a well-rounded introduction. It is great having a way to mathematically find these values instead of just visually trying to point them out on a graph. You will continue exploring more theorems by learning about the mean value theorem in the next video.

Mean value theorem (6 min 50 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's move on to another theorem, the mean value theorem. This theorem is a very important one for much of calculus and it is often used with many first and second derivative tests. Before I teach you about the mean value theorem though, let's first learn what Rolle's theorem is. Rolle's theorem begins with a function f of x needing to meet the following three conditions. First, f of x must be continuous on a closed, bounded interval a to b. Second, f of x must be differentiable on an open interval a to b, and finally, the function of a must equal the function of b. If all these conditions are true, then there exists a number C such that a less than c less than b and f prime of c is equal to zero, as in the derivative of c is equal to zero. In other words, a critical point exists for f of x within the interval of a to b. You may be wondering why you need to know about this theorem in the first place. What is proven in this theorem is a key part of what makes the mean value theorem work. When you review the definition of the mean value theorem, you'll notice a lot of similarities to Rolle's theorem. Speaking of similarities, you'll see how the intermediate value theorem is also used within Rolle's theorem and the mean value theorem. Now let's take a look at the definition of the mean value theorem. This theorem also begins with a function f of x needing to meet two conditions this time instead of three. So the first condition is f of x must be continuous on a closed, bounded interval from a to b. The second condition is f of x must be differentiable on an open interval from a to b. If both of these conditions are true, then they exists a number c such that a less than c less than b and f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a. So this is a way that you can find that derivative of c. As you may have noticed, Rolle's theorem is essentially a special case of the mean value theorem with that extra third condition you added. In simpler terms, what the mean value theorem is stating is that somewhere on your interval, the slope equals the average slope of the function. You determine this by using the first derivative to get that average rate of change or slope. This makes sense if you think about it in a simple example of someone running. If their average speed is five miles per hour when they're running, then at some point, they will run exactly five miles per hour. Note that this theorem does not specify exactly what the value c is, simply that it exists in the first place. Also note that there may be more than one instance within the interval where the conditions are met. For example, back to the person running, they may have run five miles per hour in three, five, or 10 instances. Again, this theorem will not specify how many instances, just simply that at least one exists. Let's look at this in an example. Let's have the function f of x equal to 1/4 multiplied by x cubed plus one with the interval of x being between zero and two. Since this is a polynomial function, you know it is continuous for all real numbers and hence, on the interval of zero to two. The same is also true for polynomials being differentiable for all real numbers. So again, that is also true for the open interval from zero to two. This means there exists at least one value c in that interval of zero to two such that f prime of c equals f of two minus f of zero divided by two minus zero. Let's calculate this out. So getting your derivative, you have f prime of x equal to 3/4 multiplied by x squared by bringing that power down. Next, let's evaluate your original function at the points of zero and two. So f of zero is equal to 1/4, multiplied by zero cubed plus one, which equals one, and then f of two equals 1/4, multiplied by two cubed plus one, which equals three. Now you have your formula f prime of c equals f of two minus f of zero divided by two minus zero. Plug in your values to get f prime of c equals three minus one divided by two minus zero, which equals one. Now let's solve for c. So you can use that derivative f prime of x equals 3/4 multiplied by x squared by plugging in one for f prime of x and changing x to c. So here, you have 3/4 multiplied by c squared equals one. This simplifies to c squared equal to 4/3, and so this means c equals the square root of 4/3, which is approximately equal to 1.155. What this represents is where the slope equals the secant line, also known as the first derivative. There are two corollaries that are a consequence of the mean value theorem. A corollary is a theorem that is a simple result of a previous theorem. This term is used when a theorem can be easily derived from another theorem or is simply self-evident from its proof. You can think of it as a baby theorem. In this case, the following two corollaries can easily be derived from the mean value theorem. The first corollary deals with functions with a derivative of zero. This corollary states if f prime of x is equal to zero for all x in the interval of a to b, then f of x is constant on the interval of a to b. This makes sense since it means all the function values have the same slope equal to each other, and since it is a zero derivative, this means it all has a flat slope, meaning that it should be a constant value. The second corollary deals with constant differences, sometimes called the constant difference theorem. This theorem states if f prime of x and g prime of x for all of x in the interval of a to b, then f of x equals g of x plus C on the interval a to b with some sort of constant value c. This makes sense since the functions have the same slopes over the interval for them to be equal on that interval. Note that c could technically be zero or any other value to move the line of the graph either above or below each other. I suggest take your time on your own to further explore the mean value theorem along with its two corollaries. This theorem and its corollaries are used in various practical applications throughout calculus and help you perform many other operations in mathematics. Up next, let's take a look at the shape of a graph and how you can apply derivatives to it.

Shape of a graph (11 min 38 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this video, you'll explore how to use derivatives to gather information about the shape of a graph. Let's start by defining what increasing and decreasing means in relation to a function. Let's assume you have the values x1 and x2 on an interval I, where x1 is less than x2. So, if f of x1 is less than f of x2, then your function f of x is increasing on the interval I. If f of x1 is greater than f of x2, then your function f of x is decreasing on your interval I. This is fairly logical, where if both values are going up simultaneously, then it would be increasing, versus if one value is going up while the other's going down, that would make it decreasing. Let's use derivatives to expand upon the concept of increasing and decreasing of a function. So if you have f prime of x greater than 0 for every x on the interval I, then your function f of x is increasing on that interval I. Next, if f prime of x equals 0, for every x on the interval I, then your function f of x is constant on the interval I. And finally, if f prime of x is less than 0 for every x on the interval I, then f of x is decreasing on your interval I. Let's use this with an example. Let's say you have the function f of x equals x cubed minus 3, multiplied by x squared plus 1. If you get the first derivative of this, you'll get f prime of x equals 3, multiplied by x squared, minus 6 multiplied by x. Now, let's set f prime of x equals to 0 to solve for critical points. So if you have 0 equals 3, multiplied by x squared, minus 6 multiplied by x, you can then factor this to be 0 equals 3, multiplied by x, multiplied by x minus 2. This gets you two critical points of x equals 0 and x equals 2. Let's take a look at the graph of this function. So you have your function of f of x equals x cubed minus 3, multiplied by x squared plus 1, and you'll notice to the left of your y-axis where you have negative x values, it is in fact increasing where it is going up towards that y equals 1 point at x equals 0. Now, between the values of x equals 0 and 2, you'll notice that it does curve down for a little bit, and then once x is greater than 2, it does go back up in a fairly steep increase. Let's take a look at another application of first derivatives with the shapes of graphs. In this case, you'll be looking at the first derivative test. For this test, suppose you have the function f of x that has a critical point at x equals c. There are three cases, then, that you can come across. First, if f prime of x is greater than 0 to the left of x equals c and f prime of x is less than 0 to the right of x equals c, then x equals c is a relative maximum. Finally, if f prime of x is the same on both sides of x equals c, then x equals c is not a relative minimum nor a relative maximum. So note that when I mention same here, this means that it is either less than 0 or greater than 0. Let's look at this with an example. Let's say you had the function f of x equals x cubed minus 3, multiplied by x squared minus 9, multiplied by x minus 1. Let's get the first derivative, where you have f prime of x equals 3, multiplied by x squared, minus 6 multiplied by x minus 9. Now, let's set f prime of x equals to 0 to find your critical points, so you have 0 equals 3, multiplied by x squared, minus 6 multiplied by x minus 9, which factors to be 0 equals 3, multiplied by x minus 3, multiplied by x plus 1. This will get you values of x equals negative 1 and x equals 3. So you have f prime of x equals 3, multiplied by x squared, minus 6 multiplied by x minus 9. So in this case, where x is less than negative 1, f prime of x is greater than 0, meaning it is increasing. Between the values of negative 1 and 3 for x, then f prime of x is less than 0, meaning it is decreasing. And finally, for x greater than 3, f prime of x is greater than 0, meaning it is increasing. So now, if you look at the graph for this, you'll notice that for x less than negative 1, there is a very steep incline. And then between x equals negative 1 and 3, there is a very steep decline in the graph. And then again, for x greater than 0, there is a very steep inline. So this graph is much more compact with much more steeper increases and decreases than the previous example. Now, let's take a look at some second derivatives. Suppose you have a function f of x and you want to look at some concavity. So using the concavity test, you can then check to see if f double prime of x is greater than 0 for all x in an interval on I, then you can conclude f of x is concave up on the interval I. On the other side, if f double prime of x is less than 0 for all x in an interval I, then f of x is concave down on that interval I. Let's see this in an example. Let's look at the function f of x equals x to the fourth, minus 4 multiplied by x cubed. With this function, let's determine where it is concave up and where it is concave down. The first derivative of the function is f prime of x equals 4, multiplied by x cubed, minus 12 multiplied by x squared. The second derivative of the function is f double prime of x equals 12, multiplied by x squared, minus 24 multiplied by x. If you set f double prime of x equals to 0 and factor, you'll then have 0 equals 12 multiplied by x squared, minus 24 multiplied by x, which then factors to 0 equals 12, multiplied by x, multiplied by x minus 2. This gets you two critical points of x equals 0 and x equals 2. Now, if you plug in values for your second derivative, you'll have f double prime of x equals 12, multiplied by x squared, minus 24 multiplied by x. And for values of x less than 0, your second derivative f double prime of x will be greater than 0. This means it will be concave up. If you test this second derivative on the interval of 0 less than x and less than 2, then you'll have f double prime of x is less than 0, meaning it is concave down. Finally, if you look at values where x is greater than 2, then your second derivative, f double prime of x, will be greater than 0, meaning it is concave up. If you look at the second derivative graphed, you'll notice that you have a parabola. So it's that U shape, and this matches your concave-up, concave-down findings. So, you'll see for those values of x less than 0, it is a positive value on the y-axis; between the values of 0 and 2, it is a negative value on the y-axis; and for values greater than 2, it is, again, positive on that y-axis. So what if your function does not have the same concavity throughout it? If you have a point x equals c where the concavity changes on a graph of a continuous function, then it is called an inflection point. The way you often determine this is by using your second derivative test to see if it is positive or negative. So let's look at that same example where you had f double prime of x equals 12, multiplied by x squared, minus 24 multiplied by x. Let's go back to those 2 points where you had x equals 0 and x equals 3 for your critical points. So, at x equals 0, you were then changing from the concave up shape to the concave down shape. At x equals 3, you were changing from the concave down shape to the concave up shape. So this means that x equals 0 and x equals 3 are both inflection points. Lastly, let's take a look at the official second derivative test. Suppose you have a function f of x that has a critical point at x equals c where the following three cases can occur. First, if f double prime of c is greater than 0, then x equals c is a relative minimum value. Next, if f double prime of c is less than 0, then x equals c is a relative maximum value. And finally, if f double prime of c equals 0, then x equals c can be relative minimum, relative maximum, or neither. Note that the third option will require further analysis to determine which one it is. Let's go through one more example. Let's look at the function f of x equals 3, multiplied by x to the fifth, minus 5 multiplied by x cubed. Getting your first derivative, you have f prime of x equals 15, multiplied by x to the fourth, minus 15 multiplied by x squared. Next, you get your second derivative of f double prime of x equals 60, multiplied by x to the third, minus 30 multiplied by x. Use your first derivative equal to 0 in order to find your critical points, so you'll have f prime of x equals 0, which gets you 0, equals 15 multiplied by X to the fourth, minus 15 multiplied by x squared. And then 0 equals 15, multiplied by x squared, multiplied by x squared minus 1 once you factor it. This actually gets you three critical points of x equals negative 1, x equals 0, and x equals 1. So, let's look at this with your second derivative. So if you have your second derivative, f double prime of x equals 60, multiplied by x cubed, minus 30 multiplied by x. And let's first evaluate it at x equals negative 1. So you get f double prime of negative 1 equals 60, multiplied by negative 1 to the cube, minus 30 multiplied by negative 1, which equals negative 30. Since this is less than 0, it is a relative maximum. Next, you have x equals 0. So plugging that in, you get f double prime of 0 equals 60, multiplied by 0 cubed, minus 30 multiplied by 0, which equals 0. In this case, you would need further analysis since you aren't quite sure if it's a relative maximum, relative minimum, or neither. And finally, for x equals 1, you'll have f double prime of 1 equals 60, multiplied by 1 cubed, minus 30 multiplied by 1, which equals 30, which gets you the relative minimum. So if you take a look at the graph of this, you'll notice that that x equals negative 1 point. You do have that relative maximum with that little peak. At x equals 0, it's actually just a flat line at that point, and so it is neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum. And finally, at x equals 1, you have a little valley, meaning that you do have a relative minimum at that point. There are various other examples you can explore to better understand the shapes of graphs. But, this should give you a general idea of how to use first and second derivatives to help you describe the shape of your graph without visually seeing it. In the next video, you will explore optimization problems.

Optimization problems (9 min 48 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's move on to another derivative application, optimization problems. These are a great way to expand upon the concept of extreme values. Let's get started. Optimization problems seek to optimize a function by either minimizing or maximizing a particular quantity. Frequently, these problems have certain constraints dictating how small or large the value can be. Derivatives are key for solving these problems since you can use them to identify critical points and hence find possible minimum or maximum values to solve the optimization problem. Let's review some general steps to solve optimization problems. I know there's a lot of steps, so bear with me. Step one, you will understand the problem by gathering any variables and constraints or ranges, along with drawing any sketches if needed. In step two, you'll identify the quantity that needs to be minimized or maximized and if its domain is restricted. Step three, you'll write an objective function with one or more variables for the quantity being minimized or maximized. Step four, you'll write out a constraint equation if it is needed. Step five, you'll substitute the constraint equation into the objective function to rewrite it in terms of a single variable. Step six, you will find the first derivative of the objective function and set it equal to 0 to find critical points. Step seven, you will take the second derivative of the function to determine if the points are a minimum, maximum, or neither. And finally, step eight, you'll evaluate any remaining variables and ensure the solution satisfies any of the given restraints to complete your optimization problem. Let's look at a few optimization problem examples. Let's say you have the parabola y = 12 - x squared, and it's represented by the following graph where you have your blue line, and it looks like a big upside down U that intersects x = 0 and y = 12. Let's say you want to draw a rectangle under this parabola with its base on the x-axis. So, you will want to determine the rectangle you can make that has the largest area. Since the rectangle is symmetric over the y-axis, you can represent the width by 2 multiplied by x and the height by y. So note that x is going to be half the width of the rectangle. In this case, your constraint is going to be your parabola. In this case, you're wanting to maximize the area of the rectangle. Hence, this is the quantity you want to focus on. In this case, your domain spans from -x to x, where you have x greater than or equal to 0 due to symmetry. The parabola intersects the x-axis at x = plus or minus square root of 12, so you can then create the inequality of 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 12. The formula for area is given by area equals width multiplied by height. And then if you substitute in your two variables where width equals 2 multiplied by x and height equals y, you'll then get A of x = 2 multiplied by x multiplied by y. And note that this is what you want to maximize. The formula for your constraint is given by the parabola y = 12 - 6 squared. So you have your area of capital A of x equals 2 multiplied by x multiplied by y. Substituting that value in for y, you'll get A of x = 2 multiplied by x multiplied by 12 - x squared. Simplifying this gets you capital A of x = 24 multiplied by x - 2 multiplied by x cubed. If you compute the first derivative of your area, you'll get A prime of x = 24 - 6 multiplied by x squared. Now, let's set A prime of x equal to 0 to find any critical points. So if you have A prime of x = 0, this will then equal 24 - 6 multiplied by x squared. If you move the 24 around, you'll then get 24 = 6 multiplied by x squared. Divide both sides by 6 to get 4 = x squared, take the square root to get x equals plus or minus 2. Now let's get the second derivative of A double prime of x, which will equal to -12 multiplied by x. If you evaluate this at the value x = 2, you'll get A double prime of 2 = -12 multiplied by 2, which is equal to -24. Since the second derivative is less than 0 since -24 is less than 0, then this means it is a maximum value at x = 2. So here you have x = 2 where your width will equal 2 multiplied by x, which in this case your width = 2 multiplied by 2, which is equal to 2. And then you have your height, which is equal to y, which is equal to 12 - x squared. You'll then get a height of 12 - 2 squared, which is equal to 8. This means the rectangle with the greatest area underneath the parabola has dimensions of a width equal to 4 and a height equal to 8. Great job. Let's look at another optimization problem. Let's say a company wants to build a box with a square base and a open top that holds up to 32 cubic feet of content. The goal of this is to minimize the surface area of the box to reduce the amount of money spent on the cardboard to make each box. So you can have the volume of each box equal to 32 feet cubed. And then you can have a variable x be the side length of the square base of a box, and h be the height of the box. In this case, you'll want to minimize the surface area of the box, hence this the quantity you'll focus on. In this case, your domain is x greater than 0 and h greater than 0 due to the dimensions needing to be some sort of a positive value so you have some sort of material to make your box width. The formula for your quantity being minimized, which is the surface area, will be the surface area equal to the base area plus the side areas. In this case, you'll have S of x is equal to x squared + 4 multiplied by x multiplied by h. Remember, it is an open top, meaning you only need to calculate one of the square areas. The formula for your constraint is simply the volume where you have volume equals base area multiplied by height, so you'll get the volume equals x squared multiplied by h, which equals 32. So if you rearrange this, you'll get h = 32 divided by x squared. So if you have your surface area formula of S of x = x squared + 4 multiplied by x multiplied by h, you'll then get S of x = x squared + 4 multiplied by x multiplied by 32 divided by x squared once you substitute that value of h in. Once you simplify this again, you get S of x = x squared + 128 divided by x. If you take the first derivative of this to find critical points, you'll have S prime of x = 2 multiplied by x - 128 divided by x squared. Let's equal S prime of x = 0 to get those critical points, which will get you S prime of x = 0, which equals 2 multiplied by x - 128 divided by x squared. If you rearrange this equation by doing some division and multiplication, you'll get 64 = x cubed, which if you take the cube root of that, you'll have x = 4. Since x = 4 is greater than 0, it does fit in your domain so you're good to start looking at the second derivative. So you'll have S double prime of x = 2 + 256 divided by x cubed. And again, let's look at where x = 4. So you'll get S double prime of 4 = 2 + 256 divided by 4 cubed, which is equal to 6. Since the second derivative is greater than 0, where 6 is greater than 0, this means it is a minimum value. This gets you a result of x = 4 to optimize your square box for your side length equal to 4 feet. So let's get the height where you have volume equal to x squared multiplied by h = 32. Rearranging this gets h = 32 divided by x squared. Plug in 4 to get h = 32 divided by 4 squared, which means h just equals 2 So now let's plug this in to your surface area formula of S of x = x squared + 4 multiplied by x multiplied by h, which gets you S of x = 4 squared + 4 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 2, which is equal to 48 feet squared for your box to minimize that surface area for that volume. This means your final box dimensions will be 4 feet by 4 feet by 2 feet. There are various practical ways you can use derivatives to work with optimization problems in the real world. In physics, you can work with problems to minimize energy and maximize efficiency. In economics, you can use them to maximize profit, minimize cost, and optimize resource allocation. And finally, in business, you can use them to maximize sales and minimize inventory costs. There's a lot to explore when it comes to optimization problems, such as the various ones I showed in the previous slide when it came to physics, economics, and business, but know that that is just the beginning. Next, let's take a look at L'Hopital's rule.

L’Hopital’s rule (6 min 30 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's continue applying derivatives by exploring L'Hôpital's rule. This rule is named after 17th century French mathematician Guillaume de L'Hôpital, but note that this theorem was technically introduced by Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli first in 1694. This is why it is sometimes referred to as Bernoulli's rule. If you remember from when I discuss calculating limits using factoring, that sometimes you can get an indeterminate form. This can be the case with derivatives as well. Let's review the list of some indeterminate forms you may come across. You may come across zero divided by zero, zero multiplied by infinity, infinity divided by infinity, infinity minus infinity, infinity to the zero, zero to the zero, and finally, one to infinity. The reason why L'Hôpital's rule is helpful is because you can use it to calculate limits of functions that yield indeterminate forms like the ones I listed previously. In order to calculate the limit though, you'll need to understand how to calculate derivatives. Let's learn exactly what L'Hôpital's rule is. Let f of x and g of x be differentiable functions over an open interval containing the real constant value a. So if the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals the limit as x approaches a of g of x, and those limits equal either zero, positive, or negative infinity, and if the limit as x approaches a of the derivative of f of x divided by the derivative of g of x either exists or equals positive or negative infinity, then your limit as x approaches a of f of x over g of x is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f, prime of x divided by g prime of x. I know this rule has a lot going on, so I will break it down for you. First, you need to ensure the limits equals zero, positive or negative infinity for the functions f of x and g of x. Next, you need to make sure the derivatives of f of x divided by g of x exist, or equal positive or negative infinity. If either of those conditions are not there, then you cannot use this rule. If all of the above is true though, this rule allows you to take the limit of the derivatives divided, often converting the limit to something that can be much more easily evaluated in the process, versus evaluating the original limit. Let's go through some examples. First, let's evaluate the limit as x goes to zero of sine of x divided by X. Currently, this is in the indeterminate form of zero divided by zero. Since the limit for both of these functions individually is zero, and their limit of the derivatives would exist since the denominator would turn from x to one with the derivative, and the numerator would be cosine of x instead of sine of x, you would be good to go in order to use this rule. Let's bring this together so you have a prime of x equal to one for your denominator, and then for your numerator you'll have f prime of sine of x, which is equal to cosine of x. So if you bring this into your limit, so you have the limit of x to zero of your derivatives of cosine of x divided by one, this is the same as getting the limit as x goes to zero of cosine of x. In this case, you can use substitution to have it be cosine of zero, which is equal to one. Now using L'Hôpital's rule, you can say that the limit as x goes to zero of sine of x divided by x is equal to the limit as x goes to zero of cosine of x, which equals one. This time, let's evaluate the limit as x goes to infinity of e to the x divided by four, multiplied by x squared. This is currently in the indeterminate form of infinity divided by infinity. Since the limit for both of these functions individually is infinity, and the derivatives of them would exist, or again, equal infinity, you should be good to go to use L'Hôpital's rule. Let's break this down. So you have f prime of e to the x equals e to the x, since the derivative of e to the x is itself, then you have f prime of four multiplied by x squared equals eight multiplied by X using the power rule. So you have the limit as x goes to infinity of e to the x divided by four, multiplied by x squared is equal to the limit as x goes to infinity of e to the x divided by eight multiplied by x, but this is still unfortunately in that form of infinity divided by infinity. The great thing though is you can apply L'Hôpital's rule again to get a more simplified form to make sure that you can properly solve this limit. So here you have f prime of e to the x is still equal to e to the x, and then f prime of eight multiplied by X is equal to eight. So now you're saying the limit as x approaches infinity of e to the x divided by eight multiplied by x is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of e to the x divided by eight, which simply equals infinity. So you can bring that back to your original limit as x goes to infinity of e to the x divided by four, multiplied by x squared is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of e to the x divided by eight, which equals infinity. In this case, the limit technically does not exist because it is to infinity, but it's good to know that infinity is the final result. This is a great case where you can apply L'Hôpital's rule multiple times, and again, get some sort of an actual result. L'Hôpital's rule is great for simplifying the process of finding limits that may be difficult to compute directly due to their indeterminate forms. This rule can help evaluate asymptotic behavior by determining growth rates of functions. It can also be used in proofs and evaluations for improper integrals and series when infinite limits exist. I suggest take your time on your own to continue exploring L'Hôpital's rule. It can be incredibly useful in various cases like the ones mentioned throughout this video. Up next is Newton's method.

Newton’s method (8 min 6 seconds)
- [Instructor] Last up, let's explore Newton's method. You'll see how you can use this method with derivatives to approximate solutions to functions. Let's get started. Newton's method is helpful to use when you have an equation you wish to solve for zero. This is helpful when there's no way to do so algebraically. You can use it to estimate equations like sine of X equals X or F of X equals zero equals X to the fifth, plus eight multiplied by X to the fourth, plus four, multiplied by X cubed, minus two multiplied by X minus seven. It's also great to estimates gray roots such as the square root of 38. Newton's method provides a way to approximate the solution for function F of X, where F of X equals zero. The initial estimate is referred to as X naught, and the following estimates are referred to as X one, X two, and so on. For as many iterations as you perform, Newton's method is an iterative process, meaning you can repeat it as many times as needed. Let's take a look at the formula for Newton's method. Newton's method states the approximation for function F of X equals zero is X of N plus one equals X of N, subtracted by F of XN divided by F prime of XN. Note that F prime of XN must not equal to zero in order for this formula to work. This equation is gathered from tangent lines, using that derivative. Remember, you can run this process as many times as you want, but usually, a few times usually produces a satisfactory result. When it comes to your initial approximation, a common method is to sketch a graph of the function to eyeball what the initial estimate should be. You can also find the solution for the function on an interval, and gather the midpoint of the interval to use as your initial approximation. Let's look at a few examples, using Newton's method. Let's look at the function, F of X equals X cube minus two multiplied by X minus five. And in this case, you want to find where F of X equals zero. If you look at the graph of the function represented by the blue line, it starts to go up, has a local maximum, then a local minimum, and then continues to rise. So in this case where F of X equals zero, it looks like it intersects somewhere around X equals two. So a good idea would be to have your X naught equal to two. Now let's use Newton's method of X of N plus one equals X of N minus F of XN, divided by F prime of XN where you have X naught equal to two. You'll need to find the first derivative of your equation for this. So you have F of X equals X cubed, minus two multiplied by X minus five. The first derivative of prime of X equals three multiplied by X squared minus two. Now let's plug in X naught into your equation to get X naught plus one equals X naught, minus F of X naught divided by F prime of X naught. This means you have X of one equals X naught, minus X naught cubed, minus two multiplied by X naught, minus five, divide all that by three, multiplied by X naught squared minus two. If you plug in your values, you'll get X of one equals two, multiplied by two cubed, minus two multiplied by two, minus five, divided by three, multiplied by two squared, minus two. This gets you a value of 2.1. Let's run this again to get X of two equals X of one minus X of one cubed minus two, multiplied by X of one, minus five, divided by three, multiplied by X one of squared, minus two, to then plug in your new value of X of one equals 2.1 to get you X of two, which will equal 2.1 subtracted by 2.1 cubed, minus two, multiplied by 2.1 minus five. Divide all that by three, multiplied by 2.1 squared, minus two. This gets you a value of approximately 2.0946. Note that you can continue to use this method and go to as many decimal places of accuracy as you wish, but let's just stop at two iterations for now. So you can say your approximation where F of X equals zero is at approximately X of two, which is equal to 2.0946. Let's look at an example where you will approximate a square root, so you'll have the function F of X equals X squared minus seven, where you'll have X equals square root of seven. This will then make the function equal zero. Let's have your initial approximation be X of zero equals three, and this makes sense because the square root of four is equal to two and the square root of nine is equal to three. Hence, it should lie between these two values. So you could, in this case, potentially pick two instead of three, but either one should be fine. Now, let's plug this into your formula. X of N plus one equals X of N minus F of XN, divided by F prime of XN where you have X naught equal to three. Let's get the derivative of your function, F of X equals X squared minus seven, where you have F prime of X equals two, multiplied by X. Plugging in your values, you get X of zero plus one, equals X of zero minus F of X zero, divided by F prime of X zero. This gets you X of one equals X of zero, minus X of zero squared minus seven, divided by two, multiplied by X of zero. Once you plug in your value of three, you'll get X of one equals three, minus three squared, minus seven divided by two multiplied by three. This gets you a value of approximately 2.667. If you run this again, you'll get X of two equals X of one minus x of one squared minus seven divided by two, multiplied by X of one. Plug in your value of X of one to get you X of two equals 2.667, minus 2.667 squared minus seven divided by two, multiplied by 2.667. This gets you a value of 2.6462. Note that like before, you can continue to use this method and run it as many times as you wish, for as many decimal places of accuracy that you want, but you can say your approximation where F of X equals zero is approximately X of two equal to 2.6462. Note that there are some cases though where Newton's method will not work. Let's review some of the reasons of why this method would be insufficient. First, if the derivative of F of X at F of XN equals zero at one or more of the points, then it will fail to properly converge. Another reason is if the function F of X has more than one root, then the different estimations may approximate different roots. Another reason is behavior such as oscillation, because it will cause the approximation to potentially never be able to successfully approach a root, due to that oscillating behavior. And finally, if there's a lack of a clear definition of the function, this can cause the approximations to get further and further away from the solution instead of closer to it. There are a variety of circumstances where Newton's method can be handy, such as solving trigonometric or algebra equations, along with finding square roots. I suggest taking time on your own to practice using this method, along with learning about other iterative processes. This wraps up your introduction to derivative applications. These applications help provide more context and reasoning as to why derivatives are so important and useful in the real world. I suggest take your time on your own to continue exploring the applications you learned, along with other applications. In the next chapter, I will introduce you to the third major topic of calculus, integrals.

Integrals Introduction
Anti-derivatives (2 min 49 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you will learn the third key concept of calculus, which is integrals. You'll learn what integrals are, how to define them, the differences between definite and indefinite integrals, and finally, the fundamental theorem of calculus. Let's start off with learning what anti-derivatives are. If you remember from the previous chapters, a derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable or the slope of a tangent line. Sometimes derivatives will take your function down by a dimension. For example, if you have f of x equals x squared, the derivative of that is f prime of x equal to 2 multiplied by x. So again, it's going down from that two dimension to the one dimension. So what is an anti-derivative then? Essentially an anti-derivative is the opposite of taking a derivative, hence the prefix anti in the word. The formal definition states, for a function f of x, the anti-derivative is capital F of x, such that the capital F prime of x is equal to f of x. You can think of it as going up a dimension instead of down a dimension like you would with a derivative. Let's look at an example of finding anti-derivatives. Let's say you have the function f of x equals 3 multiplied by x squared, and let's say you want to find the anti-derivative for it. If you remember from earlier examples, the derivative of g of x equal to x cubed is equal to g prime of x, equals to 3 multiplied by x squared. This means an anti-derivative for your function f of x equals 3 multiplied by x squared is equal to g of x, which is x cubed. Let's look at an example though, where you have the function h of x equal to x cubed plus 28. If you get the derivative of this function, it is also 3 multiplied by x squared. This means h of x equal to x cubed plus 28 is also an anti-derivative for the function f of x equals 3 multiplied by x squared. Why is this the case? Essentially, for a given function f of x, there are an infinite amount of anti-derivatives differing by a constant value. Note that you do not have this occur with derivatives since you are going down in dimension, and hence, you are typically taking out information versus adding information. Since you are going up in dimension instead of down, there may be information such as constants that you may not know. This is what causes the infinite possibilities. Understanding what an anti-derivative is is the first step to learning what integrals are and how to calculate them. As you saw, anti-derivatives, and hence integrals are extremely connected to derivatives. Up next, let's learn what an integral is.

What is an integral? (3 min 36 seconds)
- Great job. You have worked hard to learn about limits and derivatives. And now that you know what an antiderivative is, you will use that concept to learn what an integral is. You'll also see how integrals are closely related to antiderivatives in that they act like opposites. So let's get back to it. An integral represents the accumulation of quantities, such as the area under the curve. Let's define an integral in terms of antiderivatives. Then an integral of your function F of X would be defined as the integral of F of XDX equals capital F of X plus C. Let's break down the integral equation you saw above. So the first part, this elongated S-looking symbol S, is what is called the integral sign, and it stands for sum. Next, you have F of X, which is called the integrand. So again, that is the function you are integrating on. X is the integration variable. Next, you have DX, which is the differential of X. And then you have capital F of X, which again is your derivative of your function F of X. And then finally, you have C, which is your constant of integration. Let's review a little bit of terminology for integrals. The process of finding integrals is called integration or integrating. If you want to specify the variable you're integrating on, you can state that you're integrating F of X with respect to X. This is important when you start integrating when there are multiple variables involved in an equation. Bringing back the continuity concepts from earlier in this course, if your function F of X is continuous on a closed, bounded interval A to B, then F of X is also integrable on the interval A to B. Note that you can integrate some discontinuous functions, but they can sometimes be more difficult to integrate, require certain conditions to integrate, or they may need extra steps to solve. There are two types of integrals. First, indefinite integrals, and second, definite integrals. Indefinite integrals integrate over an entire function with no bounds. This is how the integral was formatted in the definition earlier. So it is an indefinite integral. A definite integral is when you integrate over part of a function bound between two points A and B on a closed bounded interval of A to B. You'll go into these two types of integrals in more detail in later videos. So why do you need to know about integrals in the first place? Integrals are a key concept to know because they provide you a precise way to measure areas, volumes, and other quantities in various fields and applications. They can also be used to find surface area, the average value of a function, arc length, and more. What are some common practical applications of integrals? In physics, integrals can be used to compute displacement, work, and energy. In engineering, they can be used to solve heat transfer, fluid flow, and material stress equations. And finally, in economics, they're used to model metrics like cost or revenue over time. This is just the beginning of integrals. You'll continue to learn more about integrals and see them in action throughout the rest of this course. Before you proceed with diving into integrals, let's take a moment to understand how to interpret integrals as the area under the curve.

Area under the curve (3 min 44 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now that you know what integrals are, let's take a closer look at a common interpretation of them, the area under the curve. This interpretation tends to be the most intuitive and straightforward to understand. Let's dive in. In order to look at this interpretation, you will have to use definite integrals since this interpretation does not work for indefinite integrals due to the potential for infinite area. Let's say you have a function f of x with an integral of the integral of a to b of f of xdx, over the interval that's closed and bounded a to b. The result of this integral represents the total area between the curve of f of x and the x-axis given by the bounds of a and b. Let's take a look at this graphically. Let's say you have the function f of x equals 2 multiplied by x plus 1, and you want to look at it with the bounds of x being between 1 and 3. In the graph, you'll see you have the line of the function, and then the shaded area is going to be between those values of x of 1 to 3. This shaded area is what you would find using the integral. Integrals can be useful to calculate areas that may not be easy to do with traditional algebra. This is especially true when equations get more complex. There are different types of areas that could be found using integrals. Positive area is area you gather of the function f of x that is above the x-axis. Negative area is area you gather of the function f of x that is below the x-axis. Net area combines positive and negative areas of your function f of x, and this can result in the net area being positive, negative, or even zero. The zero case happens if the positive and negative areas cancel each other out. Finally, the total area is the unsigned area of the function over the interval, and it is often represented by an absolute value sign. Generally, the area you will find when integrating is the net area. This is because integrals are tied to the accumulation of quantities, so this will give you the combination of the positive and negative areas. What this provides you with is the total change or net result over the interval you are integrating over. Just note that sometimes this will not always be helpful when trying to understand a function. Let's look at an example of the graph of the function f of x equals x cubed for the values of x between negative 2 and 2. In this case, you have the function denoted by the line, and then, again, those shaded areas are the areas between negative 2 and 2. This is a case where the net area is equal to zero since the positive and negative areas will cancel each other out. Having a result of zero is not very helpful in this case if you're trying to determine how much space is between the function f of x and the x-axis. This is a great example of needing to find the total area, instead. This should provide you a more thorough understanding of the concept of area under the curve when it comes to integrals. Remember, this interpretation only works in practice with definite integrals, but you can use the concept to mentally visualize indefinite integrals, as well. Up next, let's dive a bit deeper into area under the curve by learning about summation and how it relates and differs from integration.

Summation vs. integration (3 min 41 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned about how you can interpret integrals as the area under the curve. In order to get that area under the curve though, you will need to do some summation. Let's take a moment to understand summation, and how it is similar and different from integration. Summation is when you add up a discrete number of values, and it is usually denoted by the sigma symbol. For example, you may be adding up the values of 1 squared plus 2 squared, plus all the way to plus 7 squared, and so you can notate that with summation notation where you have sigma, so the sum of n equals 1, 2, 7, of x squared, which equals 1 squared plus 2 squared, plus all the way to plus 7 squared. When it comes to finding the area under a curve, one method you can use is a summation of rectangles underneath the curve. You can vary where you center the rectangle on the curve, such as to the left of the curve, the middle of the curve, or the right of the curve. Generally, the middle of the curve is the most desirable, and this is due to the midpoint rule. You can also vary how many rectangles you use to sum up the area such as three, five, 10 or more. It is important to note that adding up rectangles under the curve will not provide you with a 100% accurate result of the area under the curve. The error will go down with the more rectangles you have, since there will be a smaller margin between the rectangles and the curves. This is why summation is not necessarily the best method to use when finding the area under the curve. This usually causes summation to have some sort of an error correction term. This is where integration comes in handy. One way you can think of integration is that you are summing up an infinite amount of rectangles to find the area under the curve. This is what will provide you with the accuracy you desire that a summation of just discrete rectangles cannot. This means that there is no error correction term needed because it should be a 100% accurate result. Let's look at some key differences between summation and integration. For summation, you use the sigma symbol, versus with integration, you use the integral sign. With summation, you are summing up a discrete number of values, versus with integration, you are doing so with an infinite number of values. With summation, you have a lower accuracy, versus with integration, you have a 100% accuracy. With summation, you often need that error correction term due to the not 100% accuracy, versus with integration, you don't need an error correction term. And finally, with summation, you'll be finding the rectangular area, versus with integration, you'll be finding the exact area. Something to keep in mind though, with this relation is as the number of rectangles being summed increases to infinity, then the limit of the summation will approach the integral. This will also cause the values of the summation function to become the values within the integration function as the number of rectangles approaches infinity. The goal of this video is to provide you a different perspective on how to view integrals as an infinite summation, along with the benefits of using integrals over regular summation to find the area under the curve. In the next video, you will go into detail on what indefinite integrals are.

Indefinite integrals (3 min 35 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now that you have taken some time to understand some overarching concepts of integrals, let's dive into the two types of integrals. I'll start with reviewing indefinite integrals since they provide a base for definite integrals. Let's review exactly what an indefinite integral is. If you remember from earlier, indefinite integrals are very closely related to antiderivatives. An indefinite integral represents all antiderivatives of a function f of x. The way you calculate an indefinite integral is by finding the antiderivative. This is represented by the equation of the integral of f of xdx equals capital F of x plus C, where capital F of x is the antiderivative of your function f of x and C is the constant of integration. So, why does an indefinite integral represent all the antiderivatives of a function? If you remember from a previous video, I mentioned that there can be an infinite amount of antiderivatives for a function due to the ability to add any constant value to it. The way the indefinite integral represents all these possibilities is with the constant of integration C. So, what is this magical value C I keep mentioning? The value C represents a constant term that is added to your antiderivative, often called the constant of integration. This term is ambiguous and can represent any constant value you could possibly add to the core of your antiderivative. This is because you can never truly know what the constant value should be for your antiderivative due to the inability to gather that information with going up in dimension instead of going down, like you would with a derivative. So for example, let's say you have a function f of x equal to 2 multiplied by x. You can have an antiderivative capital F of x equal to x squared plus 7, or you could have an antiderivative of F of x equal to x squared plus 391. In this case, you can just use the constant value C to represent any of those numerical constant terms that can be added to it. So for example, it can represent the 7, the 391, or any other values. So this will get you capital F of x equal to x squared plus C. There are a few key properties for indefinite integrals. First, you will notice there are no bounds or limits specified. This means when you evaluate your integral, you will often get a function as the result versus a numerical answer. Second, indefinite integrals represent a general solution to a derivative where you reverse the process. Third, indefinite integrals include a constant value of integration C due to differentiation, eliminating constant values in the process since, again, you are going in the opposite direction. Finally, combining the two previous properties I just mentioned, when you solve an indefinite integral, your result will represent all the antiderivatives instead of just one numerical result. Indefinite integrals are useful when it comes to providing general solutions for practical problems in industries such as engineering and physics. They're also very prevalent when solving a branch of mathematics called differential equations. Now that you have a better understanding of indefinite integrals, you'll be better prepared with how to solve them past just finding their antiderivatives. In future videos, I will show you how to switch your mindset from deriving to integrating functions. Up next, let's explore definite integrals and see how they differ from indefinite integrals.

Definite integrals (7 min 59 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now that you have a better understanding of what indefinite integrals are, let's switch over and explore definite integrals. You'll see how indefinite integrals still provide a very necessary base when it comes to working with definite integrals. Let's start with the definition. Remember from earlier how definite integrals can be represented as the area under the curve. For a function f(x), this is represented by the equation of the integral sign of a to b of f(x)dx, which is equal to F(b) - F(a). So note that you have the anti-derivative of f(x) is represented by F(x), and this is evaluated on the close bounded interval a to b. The way you can calculate a definite integral is by finding the anti-derivative and then plugging in the boundary values accordingly to solve for it. Let's review a few key parts of the definition. First, one of the big differences from indefinite integrals when it comes to definite integrals is adding the bounds of a and b. The value A is what represents the lower limit of the integral, and the value of B is what represents the upper limit of the integral. You'll see they're often notated just the right of your integration sign with A on the bottom and B on the top part of it. Next, you'll notice that instead of just having the anti-derivative in the solution, you are actually evaluating the anti-derivative at points a and b. Since B is your upper limit, you'll calculate the value entered into your anti-derivative at that point and then subtract that by the lower limit A. So this gets you the F(b) minus F(a). Finally, you may be wondering, where did the constant of integration C go? Previously, you saw with indefinite integrals that this was always included in the integral result and was very important to include it for definite integrals. The constant value capital C actually cancels out in the definition. Let's say if you calculate the integral at just b, you would get F(b) + C. Then if you calculate the integral at just a, then it would be F(a) + C. And then if you combine these results and subtract them like you would with the previous definition, you would get F(b) + C and F(a) + C. And as you can see, your have C - C, which just equals F(v) - F(a). Let's take a look at a more technical definition of definite integrals. If you have a continuous function f(x), that is on a close bounded interval, a to b, you can divide the interval into N sub intervals with a width of delta X with each one having a point XI, then you can get the definite integral of F(x) from a to b. Where it is the integral of a to b of f(x)dx = the limit as N approaches infinity of the sum of Ii equals one to N of f(xi) multiplied by delta X. So note that the triangle is what represents an upper delta like you saw earlier with summation versus integration. Integration is when you're summing up an infinite number of rectangles to get the exact area under the curve. With this technical definition you just saw for definite integrals, it is stating that you're taking the limit to infinity, hence an infinite amount of sub intervals, and then gathering the sum of them. This will provide you with the exact area under the curve of the definite integral. There are a few different area types you can come across when it comes to definite integrals. When calculating a definite integral, you will be finding the net area. You can think of the positive area as being A1 and the negative area being A2. So the net area would be given by the formula of the integral of a to b of f(x)dx = A1 - A2. In contrast, if you got the total area, then the total area would be the integral of a to b of f(x)dx = A1 + A2. There are a few key properties for definite integrals. First definite integrals have specified upper and lower bounds a and b. Second, they represent the net area under the curve or the accumulation of a quantity. Third, your result will be a single numerical value if the integral exists. And finally, the numerical result is calculated by using the upper and lower bounds given. Another key property of definite integrals is what occurs when you reverse your bounds so you can actually interchange your bounds on any definite integral. If you do reverse the bounds, then you just need to include a negative sign to ensure that you are still getting the correct result. So let's say you have the integral of a to b of f(x)dx. If you reverse the bounds, you would then just need to add that negative sign to get negative integral of b to a of f(x)dx. So that way they still equal the same correct result, but sometimes it's easier to flip the bounds when evaluating them. Let's look at an example of a definite integral in action. Let's say you have the function f(x) = 2 multiplied by X with your known anti-derivative of F(x) = x2. And let's say you want to evaluate this from the values of X between one and three. If you look at the graph, you have the blue line, which represents your function, 2 X x, and then the shaded region between X values of one and three is where you are going to be integrating to get that total value. And in this case, this is going to be representing the net area under the curve, but in this case, it is also technically the total area under the curve because it is all positive. So let's set up your integral. So you'll have f(x) = 2 X x, F(x) = x2, and then X between one and three. So if you have the integral of a to b of f(x)dx, this will equal the integral of one to three of two X xdx. Once you integrate this using your anti-derivative, you get x2 and you'll evaluate that from one to three. So you'll note that when I want you to evaluate a definite integral, once you get the solution, it'll often be notated with a bar on the side of the result with the bottom bound being on the bottom and the top bound being on the top. So in this case, your value A is one and B is three, and so hence you see the bar and I'll notate it as one to three. So in this case, you'll be getting b2 - a2 for your result by plugging it into your integral result of x2. So this gets you three squared minus one squared equals eight as your final result. Definite integrals help provide specific solutions for various practical problems and industries such as engineering and physics. They're often used when computing areas, volumes and surface areas. You'll continue to see throughout the rest of this course various applications for integrals, along with a chapter dedicated to it near the end of the course that focuses on just integral applications. These applications will include a lot of definite integrals in them. Now you have a thorough understanding of what integrals are for both the indefinite and definite cases. Knowing these types of integrals will be very necessary when it comes to showing you a variety of integration rules and calculation techniques in the next chapter. To wrap up this chapter, let's explore an important theorem, the fundamental theorem of calculus.

Fundamental theorem of calculus (7 min 3 seconds)
- [Instructor] Everything you have learned so far has built up to what is called, the fundamental theorem of calculus. This theorem is often known as one of the most important and powerful theorems in calculus, so make sure to pay attention. Before I dive into this theorem, though, let's begin by bringing back the mean value theorem, but this time in relation to integrals. The mean value theorem for integrals states, if a function F of X is continuous over closed-bounded interval A to B, then there exists a number C, such that A less than C less than B, and F of C equals one divided by B minus A, multiplied by the integral of A to B of F of X DX. What this is stating is that there is a point C that equals the average of the function F of X. The reason it is good to know this theorem is because it is used when proving the fundamental theorem of calculus. Let's use the mean value theorem in a quick example. Let's look at the function F of X equals two plus three multiplied by X, where you are looking at the interval of X being between zero and five. Using your mean value theorem formula, you have F of C, equals one divided by B minus A, multiplied by the integral of A to B of F of X DX. Let's plug in your values. So you have F of C equals one divided by five minus zero, which is your bounds of zero to five, where zero is A and five is B, multiplied by the integral of zero to five of two plus three multiplied by X DX. Once you integrate this, you get one fifth multiplied by two, multiplied by X, plus three halves multiplied by X squared, evaluated from the values of zero to five. Let's plug in these values to get one fifth multiplied by two, multiplied by five, plus three halves multiplied by five squared, minus one fifth multiplied by two, multiplied by zero, plus three halves, multiplied by zero squared. Once you simplify this, you get F of C equals 9.5. Now you know your average value of your function between the values of X of zero to five is equal to 9.5. Now let's dive into the powerful theorem of the fundamental theorem of calculus. The fundamental theorem of calculus is what officially defines the relationship between differentiation and integration. This theorem allows you to officially calculate integrals using anti-derivatives, instead of having to only use Riemann sums and calculating areas with computationally expensive calculations. This theorem is split into two parts, so let's start by exploring part one. Part one of the fundamental the of calculus states, if a function F of X is continuous over a close bounded interval A to B, then the function capital F of X is defined by capital F of X equals the integral of A of the X of F of T DT. The function capital F of X is continuous over the closed interval A to B and differentiable over the open interval A to B. Note that the derivative capital F prime of X is equal to F of X over your interval A to B. Essentially, this part of the theorem is stating how you can connect integration with differentiation by using anti-derivatives, since they are an inverse process. Let's look at a quick example using part one of the fundamental theorem of calculus. So let's say you have the function capital F of X equals the integral of zero to X of two, multiplied by X to the fourth. Using the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus, you know the anti-derivative is equal to the function within the integral; hence, your anti-derivative F prime of X equals two multiplied by X to the fourth. Now let's look at part two of this theorem. Part two of the fundamental theorem of calculus states, if a function F of X is continuous over an interval that is close and bounded from A to B, and capital F of X is any anti-derivative of F of X, then the integral of A to B of F of XDX is equal to capital F of B minus capital F of A. This part of the theorem expands upon the relationship between integrals and anti-derivatives by allowing you to evaluate definite integrals by evaluating the anti-derivative at the end points of the interval. As you could tell, this part of the theorem is focused on just definite integrals. Let's look at this with another example. Let's say you want to evaluate the integral of zero to two of three, multiplied by X squared DX. Using your knowledge of anti-derivatives, you know the anti-derivative of three multiplied by X squared is capital F of X equal to X cubed. Now, you can evaluate using the fundamental theorem of calculus part two, where you have the integral of zero to two of three multiplied by X squared DX is equal to capital F of two, minus capital F of zero. In this case, it'll be the X cube that you plug in at your boundary values to get two cubed minus zero cubed, which equals eight. Let's look at a few practical applications for the fundamental theorem of calculus. When it comes to calculus, this theorem is very necessary to easily calculate definite integrals, along with making it easy to find areas under curves. In physics, this theorem can be used to find displacement from velocity functions and total accumulation of quantities over time. And finally, in engineering, it could be used to calculate the total charge flowing through a circuit by integrating current over time. The fundamental the of calculus, truly, provides a more unified view of calculus by connecting integrals and derivatives. This theme allows you to properly continue with calculating integrals throughout the rest of this course. This wraps up your introduction to integrals and how to compute them, using anti-derivatives. Remember, integrals are a key concept calculus and help measure the area under the curve. They will be the key focus for the rest of the chapters in this course. In the next chapter, you'll explore some of the important integration rules.

- [Instructor] In this chapter, you'll explore many of the common rules for integrals. Remember, an integral represents the accumulation of quantities, such as the area under the curve. Let's start off by reviewing the rules you are going to cover. The integration rules you will explore are the zero function, constant/constant multiple, sum/difference, power, and additivity. The sum and difference rules will be explored together since they are similar to each other. In the following chapter, you will explore integrals of common types of functions, such as trigonometric and logarithmic functions that tend to have their own nuances when calculating them. Each of the following videos will be structured similarly, to give you a general overview of each integration rule. Each video will provide you with the definition of the rule, the reasoning of why it is needed, and multiple examples of how to calculate integrals using the rule. It is important to know how to not only understand key rules for integration, but how to use them to calculate integrals in various scenarios, as well. Integrals are fundamental to calculus, so understanding how to calculate them using their rules when needed will help you better understand other key concepts later on, such as complex integrals. You can also use them to explore more advanced calculus and differential equations topics on your own. The goal of the following videos is to provide you with working knowledge on how to implement these various integration rules. You can take this knowledge and expand upon it in your work and education. Let's get started with exploring the zero function.

Zero function (1 min 37 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's start off with an easy integration rule. This is when you integrate a zero function or, simply put, integrate the value zero. Let's first review the derivative of the zero function. Let's say you have the function f of x equals zero. If you remember with derivatives, the derivative of this function would be zero, no matter how many times you took it. This comes from the derivative of a constant being zero, especially if it is already zero. This is not the same case with integrals. With integrals, you sometimes lack information about the function you are working with, since you are going in the opposite direction as you would with a derivative. One of the key pieces of information you may be missing is a constant value, such as 6 or 732, but there's no way for you to know exactly what the constant value should be. This is where the zero function rule comes in handy for integrals. If you have a function f of x equals zero, then the integral of it is the integral of 0dx and it simply equals C, which is any constant value. You can think of this in terms of the anti-derivative, where zero is the derivative of any constant value C. This rule is fairly straightforward, where, whenever you integrate just the value zero, then the result will always be C to represent an unknown constant value. This rule can be proven with the fundamental theorem of calculus, which you can explore on your own. Up next, let's explore constant rules.

Constant rules (5 min 29 seconds)
- [Instructor] Up next are Constant Rules for Integrals. There are two constant rules you will cover in this video, including the constant rule and the constant multiple rule. These will be formatted very similarly to their derivative counterparts. Let's start with a constant rule. The constant rule states for any constant C1 where you have your function f of x equal to C1, then the integral of C1 dx equals C1 multiplied by x plus C2. Note that C2 here is another constant that you add on to your result. This rule makes sense since the graph of any constant value has a slope of zero and an integral is gathering the area underneath that function. Since that accumulation is proportional to x, it creates a linear function as the result. Let's look at an example of this. Let's say you have a function f of x equal to seven. If you take the indefinite integral of it, you can use the constant rule to get the integral of 7dx equals seven multiplied by x plus C. Let's add some bounds to this to make it a definite integral where your bounds are one and three. So you'll simply plug in the values of one and three into seven multiplied by x plus C to get seven multiplied by three, minus seven multiplied by one. Note that the constant is left out here because it will just cancel out in the end. So this gets you a final result of 14. Next, let's take a look at the constant multiple rule. The constant multiple rule states, for function g of x equal to C, multiplied by a function f of x with any constant C, the integral is then the integral of g of x equals the integral of C, multiplied by f of x dx, and this is the same as C multiplied by the integral of f of x dx. Essentially, this rule works the same as it would for derivatives where you take out the constant value, perform the integral of your function, and then multiply your constant value with your integral result. You might be confused as to why the constant stays the same when the previous rule made the constant expand with an x. This is because when you are integrating just the constant function C, then you are focusing on integrating that function to find the area under the curve. This is different when you multiply a constant C because, in this case, the function being integrated on is f of x, where C just turns into a fixed multiplier that scales the result of the integral of f of x. Let's look at a few examples of the constant multiple rule. Let's say you have the function f of x equal to five multiplied by x. Now let's take the integral of this to get the integral of five multiplied by xdx. When taking the integral of this, you can simply move the five outside of your integral to multiply at a later point, so this turns it into five multiplied by the integral of xdx. Now you just need to take the integral of x, which you previously learned is equal to x squared divided by two. Now you bring back in your constant, so you have five multiplied by x squared, divided by two, and make sure you add in your constant C. If you simplify this a bit more, you get a final result of five multiplied by x squared divided by two, plus C. Let's add some bounds to make this a definite integral, where you'll have bounds between zero and two. You simply plug in these values with your function five multiplied by x squared divided by two plus C. So this gets you five multiplied by two squared divided by two, and subtract that with five multiplied by zero squared, divided by two. Again, remember, the C is left out because that concept of integration simply cancels out in the process, so it's not necessary to put it in there. This gets you a final result of 10. Let's look at one more example of this rule in action. Let's say you have a function f of x equal to x divided by four. You might be worried at first since you're dividing your function x by the constant four, but this is the same as multiplying x by the fraction 1/4. This means that you could still use the constant multiple rule, so if you take the integral of this separated out, you have the integral of 1/4 multiplied by xdx. Now, you can move that constant out, so you have 1/4 multiplied by the integral of xdx. Like you learned before, the integral of x is simply x squared divided by two, so you have 1/4 multiplied by x squared divided by two. Add C to that, and then you can simplify this to get a final result of x squared divided by eight plus C. This should give you a solid understanding of how to use the constant rule and constant multiple rule for integrals. These rules are simple yet effective when it comes to knowing how to quickly and easily solve integrals, especially when the functions within them become more complicated. It also helps that these rules function very similarly to the derivative rules you previously learned. In the next video, you'll explore the sum and difference rules.
Sum and difference rules (8 min 27 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next, let's explore the sum and difference rules for integrals. These rules are essentially one and the same, but they're sometimes referenced separately. It is important to know how both of these rules work since they can be extremely helpful when solving integrals. Note that these also function similarly to their derivative counterparts. Let's begin with the sum rule. The sum rule states the integral of a sum of functions is the same as the sum of their integrals. This is represented by the functions H of X equal to the function F of X, added, with the function G of X. The integral of the function H of X is equal to the integral of H of X DX, equals the integral of F of X DX, plus the integral of G of X DX. Next is the difference rule. The difference rule states the integral of a difference of functions is the same as the difference of their integrals. This is represented by the functions H of X is equal to the function of F of X minus the function of G of X, where you have the integrals be the integral of H of X DX, equals the integral of F of X DX, minus the integral of G of X DX. As you could tell, these rules are very similarly defined. Sometimes they're referenced together and represented by the following equations. So you have your function H of X equal to your function, F of X, plus or minus your function G of X, where the integral of H of X DX is equal to the integral of F of X DX plus or minus the integral of G of X DX. How do these rules work? When you take an integral, you're finding the area under the curve of a function. Since you have two separate functions when you add or subtract them from each other, you can handle the functions individually to find their areas under the curve. Once you find this for each function, you can combine the results in order to get your final result. Let's look at a few examples of these rules in action. Let's start off with an example for the sum rule where you have your function F of X equal to 17, plus two, multiplied by X. So here, you have your integral of F of X DX, equals the integral of G of X DX, plus the integral of H of X DX. In this case, your G of X is equal to 17 and your H of X is equal to two, multiplied by X. So this means your integral of 17 plus two multiplied by X DX is equal to the integral of 17 DX, plus the integral of two, multiplied by X DX. First, you have your integral of 17 DX, which using the constant rule, is simply going to be 17 multiplied by X plus C. Next, you have your integral of two multiplied by X DX, which using the constant multiple rule and the knowledge of the integral of X, you have a result of two multiplied by X squared divided by two, plus C, which if you simplify that, is simply X squared plus C. So now to get your integral of F of X DX, you simply add these two results together. So you'll add 17 multiplied by X plus C, and add that with X squared plus C. This gets you a final result of X squared plus 17 multiplied by X plus C. Note that the two constants of integration are simplified to just one C, because C represents any unknown constant. This means you can just have one C to represent whatever value they would take, combined. Let's look at another example. This time, with the difference rule. Let's look at the function F of X equals three, multiply by X, minus 15. Again, like last time, you'll separate these two functions to calculate their integrals. So you have the integral of F of X DX, equals the integral of G of X DX, minus the integral of H of X DX. In this case, you'll have G of X equal to three multiplied by X, and your function H of X equal to 15. So this means your integral three multiplied by X minus 15 DX is equal to the integral of three multiplied by X DX, subtracted by the integral of 15 DX. Let's first give the integral of three multiplied by X DX, using the constant multiple rule, and the knowledge of what the integral of X is, and this will get you a result of three multiplied by X squared divided by two plus C. Next, you'll get the integral of 15 DX, which is simply equal to 15 multiplied by X plus C, since again, you're using that constant rule. Now to get your integral of F of X DX, you'll subtract these two integral results to get three multiplied by X squared, divided by two plus C, and you'll subtract all that by 15 multiplied by X plus C. This gets you a final result of three multiplied by X squared, divided by two, subtracted by 15, multiplied by X plus C. Note that you still want to keep your constant of integration C in your final result, even if they technically subtracted out in the previous line, because again, you need to make sure that you account for the unknown constant value you might get when you are integrating a function. Let's add some bounds to this to make it a definite integral, where you can have bounds between two and six. So you'll plug in your bounds two and six into your function three, multiplied by X squared, divided by two, minus 15, multiplied by X plus C. So if you plug these in, you get three multiplied by six squared, divided by two minus 15 multiplied by six. Then you'll subtract all of that by three, multiplied by two squared, divided by two, and then you'll subtract 15 multiplied by two. If you calculate all this out, you get a final result of negative 12. Let's do one more example where you combine the sum and difference rules. Let's say you have the function F of X equal to eight, multiplied by X, subtracted by X, plus 40. Even though there are three functions this time with both addition and subtraction, you'll still separate these functions like you did before to calculate their integrals. So here, you have the integral of F of X DX equal to the integral of G of X DX, subtracted by the integral of H of X DX, added with the integral of J of X DX. In this case, your G of X is equal to eight, multiplied by X, H of X is equal to X, and J of X is equal to 40. So this means your integral of eight, multiplied by X, subtracted by X, plus 40 DX is equal to the integral of eight, multiplied by X DX, subtracted by the integral of X DX, added with the integral of 40 DX. Let's get the integral results for these three separate functions. So first, you have the integral of eight multiplied by X DX, which is equal to eight, multiplied by X squared divided by two plus C, and that simplifies to four multiplied by X squared plus C. Next, you have the integral of X DX, which is simply X squared divided by two plus C. Finally, you have the integral of 40 DX, which is equal to 40 multiplied by X plus C. So if you bring this together to get your integral of F of X DX, you get four multiplied by X squared plus C, minus X squared divided by two plus C, plus 40, multiplied by X plus C. If you simplify this, you get a final result of four multiplied by X squared, minus X squared, divided by two, plus 40 multiplied by X, plus C. Note that again, you want to make sure, you have your one constant of integration to account for any of the unknown values when integrating. This should give you a solid understanding of how to use the sum and difference rules when integrating. These rules are super helpful to use to separate out an integral, to make it easier to calculate in smaller pieces. Up next, let's explore the power rule.

Power rule (5min 50 seconds)
- [Instructor] You may have noticed I have not shown you any integral examples of functions with exponents other than one so far. This is because there is a whole rule of how to deal with exponents called the power rule, same as with derivatives. Let's begin with the definition. The power rule states for a function f of x equal to x to the n with any constant n, the integral for this function is going to be the integral of f of x dx is equal to the integral of x to the n dx and this is equal to one divided by n plus one multiplied by x to the n plus one, plus C. An easy way to think of this rule is that you take the current exponent and increase it by one, and then you divide your function with a new exponent as a constant value. Note that this rule does not apply for functions where you have n equal to minus one or where you have a to the x with a constant value, a not equal to zero, to the value of x. These two situations will be covered in later videos when you review how to work with polynomial, rational, and exponential integrals. You'll notice that you are already using this rule when taking the integral of x. So for example, you have your function f of x equal to x, and this is actually the same as x to the one. So if you take your integral of f of x dx, this equals the integral of x to the one dx. So if you go through this process, you have this equal to one divided by one plus one, and then you multiply that by x to the one plus one, and then you'll add C. As you saw before with your rule in this case, your n is equal to one, and so that's where you're adding it into the formula you saw before. If you simplify this, you get 1/2 multiplied by x squared plus C, which simplifies to x squared divided by two, plus C. As you may have realized, this is essentially doing the opposite of the power rule for derivatives. This rule can be proven using multiple techniques such as Riemann sums or the inverse relationship between derivatives and integrals. I suggest taking time on your own to explore these proofs if you wish to have a more thorough understanding of the why behind how this rule works. Long story short, when you use the inverse relationship technique, you simply take the integral of the power rule for the derivatives to get the power rule for integrals. Let's look at a few more examples of using the power rule. Here. You have the function f of x equal to eight multiplied by x to the third. In this case, let's first separate out the constant using the constant multiple rule. So you have the integral of f of x dx equals eight, multiplied by the integral of x cubed dx. With this result, you'll have eight multiplied by your result of your integral. So here, you have n equal to three, so you have one divided by three plus one multiplied by x to the three plus one. Then you'll add C to that. If you simplify the portion within the parentheses, you have eight multiplied by x to the fourth to divided by four plus C. Simplify this a little bit more to get a final result of two multiplied by x to the fourth plus C. Let's look at another example. Let's get the integral for f of x equal to six multiplied by x to the fifth plus nine multiplied by x squared. Remember, you can separate out the constant six and nine using the constant multiple rule, and then you can use the sum rule to separate out the functions x to the fifth and x squared. This means the integral of f of x dx is equal to six multiplied by the integral of x to the fifth dx plus nine multiplied by the integral of x squared dx. Let's first look at the integral six multiplied by the integral of x to the fifth dx, and this is equal to six multiplied by one, divided by five plus one multiplied by x to the five plus one. This is because your n equals five in this case, and again, make sure you add C to this. If you simplify this, you get six multiplied by x to the six divided by six plus C, which is simply x to the six plus C. Looking at your second integral, you have nine multiplied by the integral of x squared dx, which is equal to nine multiplied by one, divided by two plus one, multiplied by x to the two plus one. Remember, in this case, now your n equals five. Make sure you add C to that result. In this case, that equals nine multiplied by x cubed, divided by three plus C, which is equal to three multiplied by x cubed plus C. If you combine these results together for f of x, you get x to the six plus C, plus three multiplied by x cubed plus C to get a final result of x to the sixth plus three multiplied by x cubed plus C. Let's add some bounds to make this a definite integral where you are going between the values of one and four. So you'll plug in the values of one and four to your equation x to the six plus three multiplied by x cubed plus C. So here, you have four to the six, plus three, multiplied by four cubed, subtracted by one to the sixth, plus three, multiplied by one cubed, which gives you a total result of 4,284. The power rule is very important and will be heavily used in the following videos with a variety of functions. Remembering the easy trick of increasing the exponent by one and dividing the function by the new exponent will significantly speed up the process when calculating integrals. Let's wrap up this chapter by exploring additivity over integrals.

Additivity over intervals (6 min 35 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's conclude this chapter and explore a rule that pertains to just definite integrals. This is because this rule deals with the intervals that are integrated over. Let's look at the definition for the rule additivity over intervals. Additivity over intervals states for a definite integral with any real number c, you have the integral from a to b of your function f of x, dx, is equal to the integral from a to c of f of x, dx, plus the integral from c to b of f of x, dx. Note that c does not have to be between the values of a and b because this rule will work with any value. This rule is sometimes called the linearity of integration. There are a variety of ways to prove this rule, such as Riemann sums, the fundamental theorem of calculus, or using Lebesgue integration theory. I suggest taking time on your own to explore these proofs if you wish to have a more thorough understanding of the why behind how this rule works. One of the main uses for this rule is when you have adjacent intervals a and c, and c and b that you wish to integrate over. It can also be used to simplify evaluating definite integrals over complex intervals by breaking them into smaller pieces. Let's look at a few examples of this rule in action. Let's say you have the integral from 0 to 10 of the function three multiplied by x squared dx. Now let's say you want to piece up this interval and integrate it over the intervals of zero to five and 5 to 10. This means your c is going to equal five. Using the additivity over intervals rule, you now have the integral from zero to five of three multiplied by x squared dx plus the integral from 5 to 10 of three multiplied by x squared dx. Now let's solve the integral of three multiplied by x squared dx. Using the power rule, you get three multiplied by x cubed divided by three plus c, which if you simplify is just x cubed plus c. Now you can integrate this over the two intervals, and then add those two results together. So let's do the first interval for x cubed plus c between zero and five. So this gets you five cubed minus zero cubed, which equals 125. The next interval is x cubed plus c from 5 to 10, which gets you 10 cubed minus five cubed, which equals 875. If you add these two results together, 125 and 875, you get a total result of 1,000. Just to double check that this works, you can integrate this over the full interval for x cubed plus c from 0 to 10 to get 10 cubed minus zero cubed, which also equals 1,000. Now instead of having your c = 5, let's have c = 20 to have it be outside of the original interval to show that this rule still works. So here, you have c = 20 with interval 0 to 20 and 20 to 10. Note that again, even though typically you have that first value be less than the second value in that 20 to 10 case, in this case, you want to make sure that 20 is first since otherwise, this rule will not work. Let's start with your interval of 0 to 20 for x cubed plus c. So this gets you 20 cubed minus zero cubed, which equals 8,000. Next, you have your interval from 20 to 10 for x cubed plus c. So this gets you 10 cubed minus 20 cubed, which equals -7,000. If you add these two together, it is actually 8,000 - 7,000, which still gets you the correct result of 1,000. Let's look at a case where additivity over intervals is needed. Let's say you're integrating the piecewise function f of x, where you have x squared for where x is between zero and two and x cubed for where x is between two and four. If you wish to integrate f of x, dx, from zero to four, that would be difficult to do all at once because there are different parts of the function at different parts of the interval. Let's use the additivity over intervals rule to break this up accordingly. In this case, it makes sense to have c = 2 to properly split up your piecewise function to integrate. So you'll have your intervals of zero to two, and two to four. If you put this together with your new integrals, you get the integral from zero to two of x squared dx, and then you'll add that with the integral of two to four of x cubed dx. Let's get the first integral of zero to two x squared dx, which is equal to x cube divided by three plus c using the power rule. And then the next one is the integral of two to four of x cubed dx, which equals x to the fourth divided by four plus c, again using the power rule. Now let's evaluate these integrals at their bounds. So for x cubed divided by three plus c from zero to two, you get two cubed divided by three minus zero cubed divided by three, which equals 8/3. Next, you have x to the fourth divided by four plus c from two to four. So in this case, you get four to the fourth divided by four minus two to the fourth divided by four, which equals 60. If you add the results 8/3 + 60 together, you get a total result of 62 2/3. Additivity over intervals can help you better evaluate definite integrals in circumstances where the original interval is complex, or when the function being integrated becomes complicated with a specific interval. You'll see this rule come in handy when working with piecewise functions, discontinuities, changes in functions, and more. This wraps up your introduction to integration rules. These rules are all very important and will be frequently used throughout future videos to take integrals. I suggest taking time on your own to continue practicing using these rules with different functions. In the next chapter, you'll explore many common integration techniques.

Day 12
Integration techniques
Integration techniques (2 min 1 second)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you'll explore many of the common integration techniques. Integrals tend to be more complex than limits and derivatives. You have learned what integrals are and many important integration rules, but there are still many scenarios where what you have learned so far will not be enough to help you successfully solve some integrals. The goal of learning the following integration techniques is to help you bridge that gap of knowledge and help you be able to properly learn integrals of some common functions later on. The integration techniques you will explore are: Integration by substitution. Integration by parts. Partial fraction decomposition. Integration by a trigonometric substitution. And improper integrals. Note that this does not compass all techniques available to calculate integrals, but it focuses on many of the common techniques used in a variety of integration scenarios. Each of the following videos will be structured similarly to give you a general overview of each integration technique. Each video will provide you with the definition of the technique, the reasoning of why it is needed, and multiple examples of how to calculate integrals using the technique. One thing I want to note is I will show you some integration techniques that will include integrals that I have not thoroughly reviewed how you find them yet. These may be integrals of trigonometric functions or exponential functions that you'll explore more in the following chapter as far as how you find these. Note that, generally, you can use the anti-derivative technique to find these integrals, so sometimes I will mention that, and other times, just assume that I will explain how you find those types of integrals in more detail in the common integrals chapter. The goal of the following videos is to provide you with working knowledge on how to implement these various integration techniques. You can then take this knowledge and expand upon it in your work and education. Let's get started with exploring integration by substitution.

Integration by substitution (7 min 13 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's dive into the integration by substitution technique. This technique can prove very useful when working with integrals of more complicated functions. Let's take a look. So far, you have been working with straightforward functions, but what do you do when you come across functions like these? For example, you may have three minus one divided by X, multiplied by cosine of three, multiplied by X, subtracted by the natural log of X. Next, you'll have six multiplied by X squared minus five, multiplied that by each the two multiplied by X cubed, minus five multiplied by X. And finally, you have 12 multiplied by X cubed, multiplied by the cube root of three, multiplied by X to the fourth plus 80. This is where the integration by substitution method can become useful, is to solve functions like these. Integration by substitution is when you substitute parts of an integral to make it easier to solve. After you solve the integral, you then plug those values back into the results, accordingly. This is sometimes called change of variables, due to the exchange of variables in the process of using this technique. Let's take a look at the technical definition for integration by substitution. Let's say you have two functions, F of X and G of X that are continuous over a range of values. If G of X is a differential function, then you can use U equal to G of X to solve for the integral of F of G of X multiplied by G prime of X DX is equal to F of U DU. In this case, you are substituting out the function GX for U, and its derivative G prime of X DX for DU. Let's look at the steps to perform integration by substitution. Step one, you will select an expression G of X from the integral, and set it equal to U such that G prime of X is also part of the integral. For step two, you'll calculate G prime of X. Step three, you'll substitute U equals G of X and DU equals G prime of X DX. Step four, evaluate the integral with respect to U. And five, plug in U equals GX into the result and evaluate bounds if it is a definite integral. Why is this method needed in the first place? The main purpose for this method is to use it when the integral is the result of a chain rule derivative. This method also works well when dealing with composite functions. Let's use this method with a few examples. Let's take a look at the integral of X multiplied by E to the X squared DX. By traditional methods, this integral would be difficult to solve. In this case, the X squared and the exponent of E is what is proving to cause issues. So let's use your formula of the integral of F of G of X multiplied by G prime of X DX, equals the integral of F of U DU to get U equal to X squared. And then if you derive this, you then get DU equals two multiplied by X DX. The constant of two is fine to have, since you can simply divide the integral by two to ensure you get the correct result. So you can adjust this a little bit to have it be one half multiplied by DU equals X DX. Let's substitute this into your original integral. So you have the integral of X multiplied by E to the X square DX, is equal to the integral of one half multiplied by E to the U DU. You will learn later on that the integral of E to the U is just going to be itself. So this gets you a result of one half multiplied by E to the U plus C. Now if you remember, you have your U equals X squared, so let's plug this back into your result to get a final result of one half multiplied by E to the X squared plus C. Let's take a look at another example. Let's solve the definite integral of zero to 0.5 of X, divided by the square root of one, minus four multiplied by X squared DX. This is a great case to use integration by substitution with your formula of the integral of F of G of X multiplied by G prime of X DX is equal to the integral of F of U DU. In this case, the inner portion of that square root, the one minus four, multiplied by X squared seems to be causing the most issues. So you can have U equal to one minus four multiplied by X squared, and if you drive this, you get DU equals negative eight multiplied by X DX. You can adjust this accordingly to have negative one eighths multiplied by DU is equal to X DX when substituting it into your integral. Now, let's substitute this into your integral to get the integral of zero to 0.5 of X over the square root of one minus four multiplied by X square DX is equal to the integral of zero to 0.5 of negative one eighths, multiplied by one divided by the square root of U DU. Using the power rule, you can solve this to get negative one eighths multiplied by one half, multiplied by the square root of U plus C. Combining those two fractions gets you negative one fourth, multiplied by the square root of U plus C. Now let's plug in your value of U equal to one minus four, multiplied by X squared, to get you negative one fourths multiplied by the square root of one minus four, multiplied by X squared plus C. Since this is a definite integral, let's evaluate it at your bounds of zero to 0.5, to get you negative one fourths multiplied by the square root of one minus four, multiplied by 0.5 squared, and then you'll subtract that by negative one fourths, multiplied by the square root of one minus four, multiplied by zero squared. Once you calculate this all out, you'll get a final result of 0.25. Let's review some practical applications for integration by substitution. In probability, this method can be used to calculate the expected value of a random variable. In physics, it can be used to solve fluid dynamics problems where there is a pipe with a non-uniform cross-section. And finally, in engineering, it can be used to find the stored energy in a capacitor. Integration by substitution can be a little difficult to use at first, but the main difficult part is just knowing how to pick the correct U. If you are having difficulty solving your integral after substituting your U and DU variables N, then it is usually a good indication you need to choose a different U. Let's move on to another integration technique, integration by parts.

Integration by parts (8 min 44 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned how to integrate using substitution. This technique is helpful in many situations, but what do you do if this technique does not work? This is where integration by parts can become helpful. In the previous video, you saw how you can use substitution to integrate the integral of x multiplied by e to the x squared dx. You would use your formula of the integral of f of g of x multiplied by g prime of x dx is equal to the integral of f of u du. In this case, you had u equal to x squared and du equal to two multiplied by x dx. This technique unfortunately does not work though if you have a similar case, such as the integral of x multiplied by e to the five multiplied by x dx. This is because there are no possible substitutions that would work. Integration by parts is similar to the derivative product rule due to this technique often being used in cases where two functions are being multiplied together. For integration by parts, if you have an integral with two functions, f of x, and g of x, that are both differentiable, then you can use the following formula to solve the integral. So here you have the integral of f of g prime of x dx is equal to f of x multiplied by g of x. Subtract that by the integral of f prime of x multiplied by g of x dx. The previous equation can be a bit much to remember, so you'll often see this other equation used instead, where you have the integral of udv equals u multiplied by v, subtracted by the integral of vdu. In this version, u is equal to f of x, v is equal to g of x, du is equal to f prime of x dx, and dv is equal to g prime of x dx. The definite integral version of this is very similar, where you just need to evaluate both parts between your bounds of a and b. So, here you have the integral of a to b of udv is equal to u multiplied by v, evaluated from a to b, subtracted by the integral of a to b of vdu. One of the most difficult aspects of integrating by parts is deciding what your u and dv variables are going to be. Worst case scenario, you can always go back to the start if your integral doesn't work, and try different variables for u and dv. Thankfully, there is a helpful acronym many mathematicians use called I-L-A-T-E, or sometimes arranged as L-I-A-T-E, depending on the source. What does this funny acronym, I-L-A-T-E, or L-I-A-T-E stand for? For the first version of this acronym, the order is denoted with I for inverse trigonometric functions, L for logarithmic functions, A for algebraic functions, T for trigonometric functions, and E for exponential functions. The way you use this acronym is you choose u by going from top to bottom on this list to determine which u will be best. Note that this technique does not work 100% of the time, such as if you're unable to integrate your choice of dv. Let's take a look at a few examples of the integration by parts technique in action. Let's go back to that example of the integral of x multiplied by e to the five multiplied by x dx. It looks like you can split this integral into two functions, x and e to the five multiplied by x. Using the I-L-A-T-E acronym, it looks like A, for algebraic, which in this case would be x comes before e, for exponential, which in this case is e to the five multiplied by x. So let's make u equal to x and dv equal to e to the five multiplied by x dx. Now that you have your u and dv variables, let's get your du and v variables. If you derive u equals x, you get du equals dx. And if you integrate dv equals e to the five multiplied by x dx, you get v equals one-fifth multiplied by e to the five multiplied by x. Now let's use your formula of the integral of udv equals u multiplied by v, subtracted by the integral of vdu. Let's plug in your values to get the integral of x multiplied by e to the five multiplied by xdx is equal to x multiplied by one-fifth, multiplied by e to the five multiplied by x for your u multiplied by v. And then you'll subtract that by the integral of one-fifth multiplied by e to the five multiplied by xdx. So again, this is your vdu portion. Once you solve this, you can simplify the first part of this to just get x divided by five multiplied by e to the five multiplied by x. And then for your integral, you get a result of negative 1 over 25 multiplied by e to the five multiplied by x plus C. Now let's look at a definite integral example where you want to solve the integral of zero to pi of x multiplied by cosine of x dx. You'll split your integral into your two functions of x and cosine of x. Using your I-L-A-T-E acronym, with A for algebraic, and T for trigonometric, you'll have your algebraic value be x, and your trigonometric value be cosine of x. Since A comes before T, it makes sense to have your u value equal x and your dv value equal cosine of x dx. Let's get the du and v variables next. So, if you derive u equals x, you simply get du equals dx, just like the previous example. For dv equals cosine of x dx, you'll integrate this to get v equal to sine of x. Note that you can use either the anti-derivative to find this, or you'll see an explanation later on when I review trigonometric integrals. Let's use your formula, the integral of udv equals u multiplied by v, subtracted by the integral of vdu. Let's plug in your values to get the integral of zero to pi of x multiplied by e to the five multiplied by x dx is equal to x multiplied by sine of x evaluated from zero to pi, subtracted by the integral of zero to pi of sine of x dx. Again, this is using those u, v, du, and dv values you calculated in the previous slide. The first portion of your equation stays the same, so you have x multiplied by sine of x, and then the integral of sine of x is equal to cosine of x. So you'll get plus cosine of x plus C, and let's evaluate all of that from zero to pi. This gets you pi multiplied by sine of pi, plus cosine of pi, subtract all that by zero multiplied by sine of zero plus cosine of zero. This equals negative one minus one, which gets you a final result of negative two. There are many practical applications for using the integration by parts method. In engineering, integration by parts is often used to calculate coefficients and Fourier series expansions. In physics, Hooke's law has integrals to calculate the work done by a spring. In finance, you can use this method to calculate the future value of investments with continuously compounded interest. And finally, in probability, you can use this when finding the expected value of a random variable when a complex integral is required to be solved. This should give you a solid understanding of how to use the integration by parts method in order to solve integrals. This technique is very useful when working with multiple functions, and you will see it arise in multiple cases in future videos, including when proving how certain integrals work. Up next, let's explore another method, partial fraction decomposition.

Partial fraction decomposition (9 min 6 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned about integration by parts In this video, you will use a similar concept where you'll piece up an integral into multiple parts and then proceed to integrate it. This time, though, you'll work with certain types of rational functions. The next technique you will learn is called partial fraction decomposition. This technique basically does what it states in its name, which is partition a fraction into multiple pieces to allow you to integrate on those. Officially, this technique is where you break down a rational function into simpler rational functions to integrate on. If you remember, a rational function is in the format of f of x equals g of x divided by h of x where this kind of looks like a fraction. For example, you may have u of x equals x cubed plus 1 over x squared plus 5 multiplied by x minus 7. This is a rational function, but it is pretty difficult to integrate on. You may have other rational functions, though, such as v of x equal to 1 divided by 2 multiplied by x plus 7 that are easy and straightforward to integrate on, especially once you learn some tricks in the next chapter for integrating rational functions. When you have cases like u of x, though, where it's not as straightforward, this is where this method can be very useful. Let's review these steps for partial fraction decomposition. I know that these steps look fairly long, and it is a bit lengthy, so stay with me as we go through these. Step 1, you'll want to check the degree of the polynomial in the numerator to ensure it is a lower degree than the polynomial in the denominator. If this is not the case, then you will need to perform polynomial long division first. For Step 2, you will factorize the denominator into as low a factors as possible. Linear factors are the most ideal, but note that you can have higher degree factors than that, such as quadratic factors. For Step 3, you'll separate your rational function by the denominator into multiple rational functions with constants A, B, and so on for linear factors, and A1 multiplied by x plus B1, A2 multiplied by x plus B2 and so on for quadratic factors. For Step 4, you'll want to multiply both sides of your equation with the denominator. Step 5, you'll expand the equations and solve for the constant values. Step 6, you will substitute the constant values back into the partial fractions you created, and Step 7, you will split up the result into different integrals and solve. Like I mentioned before, this process is a little bit more involved and lengthy, so let's go into it in detail with an example. Let's look at the integral of 3 multiplied by x divided by x squared subtracted by 3 multiplied by x minus 4 dx. First, you will check the degree of the polynomial in the numerator. In this case, the polynomial in the numerator has a degree of 1. Then you'll check the degree of the polynomial in the denominator, which, in this case, is 2, since you have that x squared term. This means the polynomial degree is one less in the numerator than the denominator, meaning you are good to proceed. Next, you'll factorize the denominator into as low a factors as possible. For this one, you have x squared minus 3 multiplied by x minus 4. This one fairly easily factors into x minus 4 and x plus 1. Now that you have your denominator factorized, you can have your equation 3 multiplied by x over x squared minus 3 multiplied by x minus 4 equal 3 multiplied by x divided by x minus 4 and x plus 1. Now let's separate your rational function by the denominator into multiple rational functions with different constants, which, in this case, will be capital A and capital B, so this means 3 multiplied by x over x minus 4 multiplied by x plus 1. This gets you capital A divided by x minus 4 plus capital B divided by x plus 1. Remember, in this case, your constants are capital A and capital B, since both of the denominators are linear factors. Now, if you multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator x minus 4 and x plus 1, you then get 3 multiplied by x equals capital A multiplied by x plus 1 plus capital B multiplied by x minus 4. Now let's solve for the constant values of capital A and capital B. You know from your factoring that x must equal -1 and 4. Let's start off with the case of x equals -1, so here you have 3 multiplied by x equals capital A multiplied by x plus 1 plus B multiplied by x minus 4, so plugging in x equals -1 gets you 3 multiplied by -1 equals capital A multiplied by -1 plus 1 plus B multiplied by -1 minus 4. In this case, your constant capital A cancels out, so you get -3 equals -5 multiplied by B, which means B equals 3/5. Now let's plug in x equals 4, and so let's put this into your equation of 3 multiplied by x equals capital A multiplied by x plus 1 plus B multiplied by x minus 4 to get you 3 multiplied by 4 equals capital A multiplied by 4 plus 1 plus B multiplied by 4 minus 4. This time, your constant capital B will cancel out to get you 12 equals 5 multiplied by A where A is then equal to 12 divided by 5. Now let's substitute the constant values back into the partial fractions, so you had capital A over x minus 4 plus capital B over x plus 1, and now you have 12 divided by 5 over x minus 4 plus 3 divided by 5 over x plus 1. Now you have a new integral for 3 multiplied by x over x squared minus 3 multiplied by x minus 4 dx, which will now be equal to the integral of 12 divided by 5 divided by x minus 4 dx plus the integral of 3 divided by 5 divided by x plus 1 dx. Let's solve each integral. In this case, again, you can get the antiderivative, and you will learn some tricks in a later video for rational integrals as far as how to easily solve these integrals. In this case, you have the integral of 12 divided by 5 divided by x minus 4 dx is equal to 12 divided by 5 multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of x minus 4. Next, you have the integral of 3 divided by 5 divided by x plus 1 dx is equal to 3/5 multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of x plus 1. This means your final result for the integral of 3 multiplied by x divided by x squared minus 3 multiplied by x minus 4 dx is equal to 12 divided by 5 multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of x minus 4 plus 3/5 multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of x plus 1 plus C. As you saw from the previous example, this technique tends to be very involved and very computationally intensive with many steps taken to get the final solution. This technique can definitely feel complicated at times, but it is very helpful when you can factor the denominator of the rational function with ease. Why do you need to know this complicated integration method in the first place? This method not only helps you simplify the integration process for some more complex rational functions; it also allows you to facilitate something called Laplace transforms along with simplify algebraic expressions and help algorithms run. For some practical applications in engineering, this technique is used to model dynamic systems, like vibrations, and analyze electrical circuits with transfer functions. In signal processing, it could be used to break down signals and filter frequency domains, and finally, in physics, it is commonly used in quantum mechanics and when calculating gravitational potentials. Like I mentioned before, this method can definitely be complicated at times to use and very computationally intensive. There are many resources available online you can review to learn more about this method and dive deeper into some more complex examples. This method will be mentioned some but used sparingly throughout the rest of the course due to its complexity. Up next, let's explore integration by trigonometric substitution.
Integration by trigonometric substitution (11 min 25 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned how to integrate using partial fraction decomposition. Now you'll review some special cases for a select few functions where you can use triganometric substitution. This technique is not as frequently used, but it is very helpful and powerful when it is necessary. Trigonometric substitution is a method used to simplify integrals involving certain square root functions. This method replaces part of the square root with a triganometric function, making it easier to solve or possible to solve in the first place. This is done by using substitution and triganometric identities. The following three equations are the main ones you will work with when it comes to trigonometric substitutions. So first you have the square root of A squared minus X squared, where X is a variable and A is a constant value. Next you have the square root of A squared plus X squared, and then finally you have the square root of X squared minus A squared. Note that these are not the only square root equations out there that you could use triganometric substitution, but these three are the main ones that you'll come across and will give you a good idea of how to work with this technique. So for each of these three cases, these are the triganometric substitutions you would make. So for the square root of A squared minus X squared, you would then have X equal to A multiplied by sine 0 theta and DX equal to A multiplied by cosine A theta D theta. Note that with this one, you'll often use the triganometric identity of one minus sine squared 0 theta equals cosine squared 0 theta, and then theta you will then have equal arc sine of X divided by A. The next one is the square root of A squared plus X squared, where you'll have X equals A multiplied by tangent 0 theta, DX equal to A multiplied by C squared 0 theta D theta. And then you'll use the triganometric rule of one minus tangent squared theta equals secant squared theta and you'll have theta equal to arc tangent of X divided by A. Finally, you have the square root of X squared minus A squared where you'll have X equal to A multiplied by secant 0 theta DX equal to A multiplied by secant 0 theta, multiplied by tangent of theta D theta. And then you'll use the rule of secant squared, theta minus one equals tangent squared theta, and you'll have this one have theta equal to arc secant of X divided by A. Note that you'll need to solve for theta to get your final result. Let's go through some examples using these different trigonometric substitutions. Let's begin with the integral of GX divided by the square root of four minus X squared. So in this case you have the format of the square root of A squared minus X squared where you will use X equals A multiplied by sine 0 theta and DX equal to A multiplied by cosine 0 theta D theta. In this case A is equal to two, because two squared equals four, so you have the square root of two squared minus X squared, where you'll have X equals two multiplied by sine 0 theta and DX equals two multiplied by cosine 0 theta D theta. Now let's plug these into your integral to get the integral of two multiplied by cosine 0 theta D theta divided by the square root of four minus two multiplied by sine 0 theta, and that portion is going to be squared. Once you square that portion, you get the integral of two multiplied by cosine 0 theta D theta divided by the square root of four minus four multiplied by sine squared theta. Using that triganometric rule, you have one minus sine squared theta equals cosine squared theta, which in this case will be four minus four multiplied by sine squared theta equals four multiplied by cosine squared theta. Substituting the sine gets you the integral of two multiplied by cosine of theta D theta, divided by the square root of four, multiplied by cosine squared theta. Now let's simplify this integral even more where you have the integral of two multiplied by cosine theta D theta divided by the square root of four, multiplied by cosine squared of theta to just be the integral of two multiplied by cosine A theta D theta divided by two multiplied by cosine A theta. Those two multiplied by cosine of theta terms will cancel out to just get you the integral of 1D theta, which simply equals theta plus C. In this case, since A equals two, you'll have your theta equal arc sine of X divided by A, so your theta equals arc sign of X divided by two, and since you're just substituting in that value of theta, you get a final result of arc sign of X divided by two plus C for your integral result. Let's look at another example. This time you'll have the integral of DX divided by the square root of X squared plus nine. And so this time it is in the form of the square root of A squared plus X squared where you'll have X equals A multiplied by tangent of theta and DX equal to A multiplied by secant squared of theta D theta. In this case your A equals three since three squared is nine, which gets you the square root of three squared plus X squared, where you'll have X equal three multiplied by tangent of theta and X equal to three, multiplied by secant squared of theta D theta. Plug this into your integral to get the integral of three, multiplied by secant squared of theta D theta divided by the square root of three, multiplied by tangent of theta squared plus nine. Once you take the squared of that tangent term, you'll get the integral of three, multiplied by secant squared theta D theta divided by the square root of nine, multiplied by tangent squared theta plus nine. And let's use that triganometric rule where you have one minus tangent squared theta equals secant squared theta, where in this case it'll be nine minus tangent squared theta equals nine multiplied by secant squared theta. Plugging this in gets you the integral of three multiplied by secant squared to theta D theta divided by the square root of nine multiplied by secant squared D theta. Let's simplify your integral three multiplied by secant squared theta D theta divided by the square root of nine, multiplied by secant squared theta. This gets you the integral of three multiplied by secant theta D theta divided by three, multiplied by secant of theta. Once you divide out that bottom term, you simply get the integral of secant theta D theta, which equals the natural log of the absolute value of secant of theta plus tangent of theta plus C. Note that you will learn more in the next chapter of how to get this type of integral, but again, you can always use the anti-derivative as well. So using your result of natural log of the absolute value of secant of theta plus tangent of theta plus C, you'll have A equals three, and this time you'll have theta equal arc tangent of X divided by A and theta equal to arc tangent of X divided by three once you plug in that value of A. Plugging this into your integral result, you get the natural log of the absolute value of secant of arc tangent X divided by three plus tangent of arc, tangent of X divided by three, and then make sure you add your plus C at the end. This gets you a final result of the natural log of the square root of X squared plus nine divided by three plus X divided by three, and then finally plus C. Finally, let's solve the integral of the square root of X squared minus four DX In this case, it's in the form of the square root of X squared minus A squared where you have X equal to A multiplied by secant theta DX equal to A multiplied by secant theta multiplied by tangent of theta D theta. In this case your A equals two since two squared equals four. So you have the square root of X squared minus two squared, where you'll have X equals two, multiplied by secant theta and DX equals two multiplied by secant of theta, multiplied by tangent of theta D theta. Plugging this into your integral, you get the integral of the square root of two multiplied by secant of theta squared minus four, and then you multiplied that by two multiplied by secant theta multiplied by tangent of theta D theta. Once you take that squared value, you'll get the integral of the square root of four, multiplied by secant squared of theta minus four multiplied by two, multiplied by secant of theta, multiplied by tangent of theta D theta. Using the trigonometric rules, secant squared theta minus one equals tangent squared theta, you'll get four multiplied by secant squared theta minus four, equals four multiplied by tangent squared theta. Plugging this in gets you the integral of four, multiplied by tangent squared of theta, multiplied by two, multiplied by secant theta, multiplied by tangent of theta D theta. This gets you the integral of two multiplied by tangent of theta, multiplied by two, multiplied by secant of theta multiplied by tangent of theta D theta. Once you multiply these terms through, you get the integral of four multiplied by tangent squared of theta, multiplied by secant of theta D theta. Now let's use another trigonometric rule where you have the integral of four multiplied by tangent squared of theta, multiplied by secant of theta D theta where you have tangent squared of theta equals secant squared theta minus one. So plugging this in you get the integral of four multiplied by secant and squared of theta minus one, multiplied by secant of theta D theta, which gets you the integral of four multiplied by secant cubed of theta minus four, multiplied by secant of theta D theta. Once you separate this out using the difference rule and solve this, you'll then get two, multiplied by secant of theta, multiplied by tangent of theta minus two, multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of secant of theta plus tangent of theta plus C. Since your A value equals two, you'll have data equal arc secant of X divided by A, which becomes theta equals arc secant of X divided by two. This gets you two multiplied by secant of arc secant of X divided by two, multiplied by tangent of arc secant of X divided by two. And then you have this go on a second line where you have this minus two multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of secant of arc secant of X divided by two, plus tangent of arc secant of X divided by two plus C. Once you solve this all out, you'll then get a final result of X multiplied by the square root of X squared minus four divided by two minus two multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of X plus the square root of X squared minus four divided by two, and that'll be for plus C at the end. Trigonometric substitutions can be useful in a variety of situations. In mathematics, they are used to calculate arc lengths, areas of irregular shapes, volumes and surface areas. In engineering, they can be used to calculate stress distributions and deflection curves and structures like beams. In astronomy, they're often used in orbital mechanics with some of Kepler's laws. And finally, in physics, they can be used to analyze passive objects and magnetic field equations. Trigonometric substitution tends to be one of the more complicated integration techniques, as you saw with a few examples, but it can be very useful in certain instances when working with certain types of square root functions. I highly recommend taking time on your own to further explore this concept. Let's wrap up this chapter by exploring improper integrals.

Improper integrals (7 min 8 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned how to integrate using trigonometric substitution. Let's wrap up integration techniques by exploring improper integrals. These are integrals that are going to include some special cases. First of all, what is an improper integral? An improper integral is where the integral has some sort of behavior causing it to go to infinity. This is usually because either infinity is in the integration bounds, such as the integral of zero to infinity of F(x)dx, or a function becomes infinite within a defined interval, such as the integral of zero to one of one divided by x, dx. This infinite behavior is what causes the integral to be improper in nature. As you may have noticed, this type of integral only applies to definite integrals due to the need for integration bounds. So how do you deal with these types of integrals? Let's take a look at these steps. When it comes to solving an improper integral, you first start with step one by identifying if the integral is improper due to the interval involving infinity or the function becoming infinite within the interval. Note that this can include positive or negative infinity, but I just state infinity to include both. Then, for step two, you replace the improper portion of the integral with the limit. Step three, find the anti-derivative of the integral to solve it. Step four, evaluate if the limit exists. Note that you will need to do this for both positive and negative infinity separately, if both of these are contained in the bounds of your integral. And finally, step five. If the limit exists, the integral converges and has a finite result. If the limit does not exist, then the interval diverges with an infinite result. Let's take a look at this in a few examples. Let's first look at the case where you have the integral of one to infinity of e to the negative x, dx. First, you'll identify the improperness of this integral, which in this case comes from having infinity in the top bound of the integral. This is where you'll need to replace this with a limit. For your limit, let's have the limit as b approaches infinity, and then have your integral be the integral of one to b, of e to the negative x, dx. So now you'll see your integral contains b as the top bound instead of infinity. Now, let's evaluate your integral of one to b of e to the negative x, dx, by finding the anti-derivative. In this case, your result will be negative e to the negative x plus C from the bounds of one to b. When it comes to evaluating your definite integral, the constant value of integration C will be cut out in the next steps. So plugging in your bounds of one to b, you get negative e to the minus b subtracted by negative e to the minus one. This simplifies to negative e to the minus b plus e to the minus one. Now let's evaluate your limit at the anti-derivative result that you got. So here you have the limit as b approaches infinity of negative e to the negative b plus e to the minus one. In this case, you can just plug infinity into that first term where you have negative e to the negative infinity, plus e to the minus one. Looking at that first term of negative e to negative infinity, this actually goes to zero. So you can simplify this to be zero plus e to the negative one, which is just e to the negative one. Since the limit converges, you now have a final result for your integral of one to infinity of e to the negative x, dx equals e to the negative one, which is approximately equal to 0.3679. Let's take a look at another example. Let's bring back the function you saw earlier of the integral of zero to one of one divided by x, dx. This time you can identify the improperness of this integral due to the function becoming infinite within this specific interval. This is because if you have one divided by zero, this is undefined. So in this case, you will need to replace your bottom bound with a limit. So now you have the limit as a approaches zero from the right of the integral of a to one of one divided by x, dx. Now, let's get the anti-derivative of your integral of a to one of one over x, dx, which in this case is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of x plus C, evaluated from a to one. Like with other definite integrals, that plus C term will drop. So plugging in your values of a to one, you get the natural log of the absolute value of one minus the natural logarithm of the absolute value of a. The natural logarithm value of one is equal to zero. So this gets you zero minus the natural log of the absolute value of a, which is just equal to the negative natural logarithm of the absolute value of a. Now, let's evaluate your limit for the anti-derivative result. So you have the limit as a approaches zero from the right of the negative natural logarithm of the absolute value of a. Since the natural logarithm of zero is not a valid value, this then goes to infinity. This means your limit diverges, where you have the integral of zero to one of one divided by x, dx equals infinity, which means that your integral diverges. Let's review some practical applications for improper integrals. In statistics, improper integrals are helpful in calculating probabilities with infinite ranges. In engineering, they can be used to determine an electrical field that has an infinite charge distribution. And finally, in physics, they can be used to solve fluid dynamics problems where there is an infinite flow. Improper integrals is only useful for a few certain types of cases, but they can arise more than you think with the infinite tendency of some functions and having infinite bounds be more common than you would think. It is also great seeing how you can directly use limits to your advantage when integrating. This wraps up integration techniques. These integration techniques vary greatly in their complexity and uses. You will commonly see them in action with calculus proofs and when working with some common function integrals. I suggest take your time on your own to continue exploring the techniques you learned in this chapter. In the next chapter, I will introduce you to some common integrals of various functions.

Common Integrals
Polynomial and rational integrals (6 min 55 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you will explore some common integrals. These integrals will draw from many of the functions you learned about earlier in the course. Let's start off with integrals for polynomial and irrational functions. Polynomial integrals are fairly straightforward to work with once you are familiar with integration rules. The integration rules you will use are the constant, constant multiple, sum, difference, and power rules. For rational functions, things get a bit more complicated past using the rules I just listed, so I will make sure to clearly review those types of functions and how to integrate them. Let's look at an example of a polynomial integral. Let's get the integral for the polynomial function f(x) equals 3 multiplied by x to the 6th plus 2 multiplied by x to the 4th, minus 10 multiplied by x to the 3rd, plus 5. You will notice this polynomial function will require the constant, constant multiple, sum, difference, and power rules to solve. So if you want to get the integral of f(x)dx, it'll simply be the integral of your function dx. Let's look at each term individually for your integral to solve this. So first, let's get the integral of 3 multiplied by x to the sixth dx. This one, you just use the constant multiple and the power rule to increase the power and divide by the new power to get 3/7 multiplied by x to the 7th plus C. Next, you have 2 multiplied by x to the 4th dx, which, like the previous one using that power rule and constant multiple rule, to get 2/5 multiplied by x to the 5th plus C. Next term is the integral of -10 multiplied by x to the 3rd dx, which is equal to -10 divided by 4, multiplied by x to the 4th plus C. And finally, you have the integral of 5dx, which this is just going to use that constant rule where you have the result of 5 multiplied by x plus C. Let's bring all your results together and reduce the constants of integration to just 1 to get a final result of your integral of f(x)dx equal to 3/7 multiplied by x to the 7th plus 2/5 multiplied by x to the 5th, subtracted by 5/2 multiplied by x to the 4th, plus 5 multiplied by x plus C. You'll notice that I did reduce the third term from 10/4 to 5/2 'cause again, usually you want to simplify it as much as possible. Now, let's look at a special case mentioned earlier of getting the integral of the function f(x) where you have x to the power of -1,, which is also equal to 1 divided by x. So in this case, you are not able to use the power rule like you typically would. So if you get the integral of f(x)dx, this is the integral of 1/x dx, and the result for this is actually going to be the natural log with absolute value signs around your x plus C. The reason why you can't use the power rule for this is if you used it, the power would actually zero out and it would not give you the correct result. Hence, why you need to memorize this particular situation. This may be a bit confusing at first as to why a natural logarithm seems to magically appear from a rational function. This is because the natural log of x helps represent the area under the curve for your function 1/x. The reason why you need an absolute value for x in your natural logarithm is because you cannot take the natural log of a negative number. So what this does is that it ensures that you can still get your full scale of x values, even if they do include negative values. Let's look at an example where your function is equal to f(x) equals to 2 multiplied by x to the -1, which is also equal to 2/x. If you get the integral of f(x)dx, this equals the integral of 2/x dx, and the result for this is going to be 2 multiplied by the natural log of x in absolute value signs plus C. You'll notice that you just used the natural log x result that you got previously from your 1/x integral, and this time you just view that 2 as a constant multiplier, and again, you just multiply it on the outside of your result. Let's look at a similar case where you have a function formatted where it's f(x) equals 1 divided by a * x + b, where a and b are constant values. In order to get the integral for this function of f(x)dx, this will be the integral of 1/a multiplied by x + b dx, and this is equal to 1 divided by a, multiply that by the natural log, and then absolute value signs of a * x + b, and again, after all that, you add your plus C for your constant of integration. This formula for this integral is proven by using substitution in order to get the appropriate constant multiplied by the natural logarithmic function you found prior. Let's look at this formula used in an example. So let's say you have the function f(x) equals 1 divided 2 * x + 10. And so the integral of f(x)dx is equal to the integral of 1 divided by a * x + b dx. So in this case, your a is going to be equal to 2 and your b is going to be equal to 10. So if you get your integral of your function, you have the integral of 1 divided by 2, multiplied by x + 10 dx is equal to your formula of 1 divided by a, multiplied by the natural log, absolute value signs of a * x + b, and again, add your plus C at the end. So in this case, you'll plug in your a equals 2 and your b equals 10 to get a final result of 1 divided by 2, multiply that by the natural log, and again, absolute value signs of 2 * x + 10, and again, add your plus C at the end. You may be wondering why all these natural logarithms keep showing up when integrating over rational functions. This is often due to the relationship between exponential growth and logarithms, inverse proportionality, and how logarithms help convert multiplication to addition. The integrals for polynomials can be fairly straightforward as you saw in that first example, but the rational function ones can take some practice to get used to because they change into those natural logarithms in the process of integrating them. I recommend taking time on your own to practice getting integrals of these types of functions to make sure you are familiar with them. In the next video, I will show you how to work with trigonometric integrals.

Trigonometric integrals (6 min 20 seconds)
- [Instructor] Up next are trigonometric integrals. Trigonometric integrals can be complicated to understand at first, like with trigonometric derivatives, my best advice is to memorize these integrals since that is usually the best option to learn how to solve them. These are the integrals for the six main trigonometric functions. So your integral of sine of x dx equals negative cosine of x plus capital C for your constant of integration. Next, you have the integral of cosine of x dx, which is equal to sine of x plus C. Then the integral of tangent of x dx is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of secant of x plus C. The integral of cosecant of x dx equals the natural log of the absolute value of cosecant of x minus cotangent of x plus C. The integral of secant of x dx equals the natural log of the absolute value of secant of x plus tangent of x plus C. And finally, the integral of cotangent of x dx equals the natural log of the absolute value of sine of x plus C. There are a few important combinations of trigonometric functions where it is helpful to memorize their integrals as well. Let's begin by looking at the case where you integrate some different combinations of sine and cosine. So you have the integral of sine squared of x dx is equal to x divided by two, minus sine two, multiplied by x divided by four plus C. Next, you have the integral of cosine squared of x dx equals x squared plus sine of two multiplied by x divided by four plus C. And finally, you have the integral of sine of x multiplied by cosine of x dx, which equals sine squared x divided by two plus C. So you'll see how these are all formatted very similarly. Another important combination to look at is different combinations of cosecant, secant, cotangent and tangent. These are some of the popular combinations you'll come across. The integral of cosecant squared x dx equals negative cotangent of x plus C. The integral of secant squared of x dx equals tangent of x plus C. The integral of secant of x multiplied by tangent of x dx is equal to secant of x plus C. And finally, the integral of cosecant of x multiplied by cotangent of x dx is equal to negative cosecant x plus C. Like with derivatives, the different properties dealing with the sine and cosine functions are key to finding their integrals. The reason why natural logarithms show up with other trigonometric function integrals is because they use ratios of sine and cosine, hence leading to the need of logarithms when integrating. Like I mentioned before, I highly recommend you memorize these different trigonometric integrals since that tends to be the easiest way to work with them. Let's look at a few examples of trigonometric integrals in action. Let's begin by getting the integral of the cotangent function where you have cotangent of x equals cosine of x divided by sine of x. For this one, you'll be using substitution where you'll have u equals sine of x and du equals cosine of x dx. So your integral of cotangent of x dx is equal to the integral of cosine of x divided by sine of x dx. Once you substitute in your u and du, you get the integral of one divided by u du. The integral of one divided by u is going to be a natural logarithm, so you'll get the natural log of the absolute value u plus C, and if you plug in your value of u equals sine of x, you get the natural log of the absolute value of sine of x plus C. Let's look at another example. This time, you have the integral of cosecant to the six of x multiplied by sine to the fifth of x dx. Note that you can rewrite sine to the fifth of x equal to sine squared of x squared multiplied by sine of x. Plugging this in, you get the integral of cosine to the sixth of x multiplied by sine squared of x squared multiplied by sine x dx. Let's look at a trigonometric rule where you have sine squared of x equals one minus cosine squared of x. Plugging this in gets you the integral of cosine to the six of x multiplied by one minus cosine squared of x and square all that, multiply that by sine of x dx. Using substitution, you get u equals cosine of x and du equals negative sine of x dx. Plugging this into your equation, you get the integral of u to the sixth multiplied by one minus u squared and then squared that, multiplied by negative du. Simplifying this, you get the integral of negative u to the sixth plus two multiplied by u to the eighth minus u to the 10th du. Once you solve this, you get negative u to the seventh divided by seven, plus 2/9 multiplied by u to the nine minus u to the 11 divided by 11 plus C. Substitute this in to get a final result of negative cosine to the seventh x divided by seven plus 2/9 multiplied by cosine to the ninth of x minus cosine to the 11th of x divided by 11 plus C. Let's do one more example with the integral of tangent to the fourth x multiplied by secant squared x dx. Let's use substitution where u equals tangent of x and du equals secant squared of x dx. So this means you're integral of tangent, the fourth of x multiplied by secant squared of x dx equals the integral of u to the fourth du. Solving this, you get u to the fifth divided by five plus C and plug it in your value of u equals tangent of x, you get tangent of x to the fifth divided by five plus C as your final result. Like I have mentioned a few times, memorization is key when it comes to working with trigonometric integrals. Once you have those memorized, then it's fairly straightforward as far as plug and play with solving different variations and combinations of them. I recommend taking time on your own to practice getting these integrals, and if you wish to look up the proofs of how these integrals work in the first place. Note that this is not the last you'll see of trigonometric functions or related functions in this chapter. Up next, I will show you how to work with exponential integrals.

Exponential Integrals (3 min 47 seconds)
- [Instructor] Next, let's take a look at exponential integrals. These are integrals that contain exponents where the variable itself is in the exponent, such as e to the x. This video will not cover functions where you have a simple power in the exponent, such as X to the fifth, since you could simply use the Power Rule to solve those types of functions. Let's begin by looking at general exponential functions in the format where you have f of x equals a to the x, where you have your constant value a, and it is greater than zero and not equal to one. Like I mentioned previously, you cannot use the Power Rule to solve this function because the variable is in the exponent instead of the base. If you wish to get the integral of a function in the format of f of x equals a to the x, where a is greater than zero and not equal to one, you will use this formula where you have the integral of f of x dx equals a to the x divided by the natural log of a plus C. Again, you'll note here that you don't need absolute value signs on the natural log because a is already supposed to be greater than zero. Essentially, this integral will simplify to your original exponential function divided by a constant natural logarithmic value. You'll notice that this is the opposite of how you derive an exponential function where you multiply your function a to the x by the natural log of x. Let's look at an example where you have your function f of x equals three to the x. So in this case, your a is equal to three. So let's get the integral of f of x dx, and so this will equal the integral of three to the x plus C. So if you use your formula that you had prior, you'll have the integral of f of x dx equals a to the x divided by the natural log of a plus C. And then this gets you a final result of integral of f of x dx equals three to the x divided by the natural log of three plus C. Since again, your A is equal to three here. Now let's look at the special case for the natural exponential function, f of x equals e to the x. If you use the same integration rule as before for your function f of x equals e the x, you'll get the integral of f of x dx equals a to the x divided by the natural log of a plus C, which in this case is going to be e to the x divided by the natural log of e plus C. Since this simplifies to e to the x divided by one plus C, that also simplifies to e to the x plus C. So you actually have a more simplified version where the integral of e to the x dx is simply equal to e to the x plus C. As you'll notice, this is the same as when you derive the function f of x equals e to the x, where again, the derivative is itself. So it's the same with integration, the integral is itself. Let's look at another example, but this time with that natural exponential function. So here you have your function, f of x equals four multiplied by e to the x. So here, remember you have integral of each of the x dx is simply equal to each of the x plus C. So again, itself just adding that constant of integration. So if you have your integral of f of x dx equal to the integral of four multiplied by e to the x dx, your final result is simply going to be four multiplied by e to the x plus C. Since your four is just going to be using that constant multiple rule and just being applied to the result at the end. Knowing how to work with exponential functions, including those containing other functions, will help you with more complex integrals you will work with in the future. Next, you will learn about logarithmic integrals, where you'll see how they continue to produce logarithms, like how exponential integrals like to produce exponents.

Logarithmic integrals (4 min 44 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now let's explore logarithmic integrals. You will explore how to integrate functions, such as log 10 X and natural log of X. You will notice how these integrals work similarly to those of exponents with how they produce logarithms and their results, like how exponential functions produce exponents in their results. Let's begin by looking at a general logarithmic function in the format F of X equals log base A of X, where X is greater than zero and A is greater than zero and not equal to one. Note that you can't use any of the previous integration rules to properly solve this type of function because the variable is within the logarithm. If you wish to integrate the function F of X equals log base A of X where X is greater than zero and A is greater than zero and not equal to one, then you'll use the following formula. So here you have the integral of F of XDX equals one divided by the natural log of A plus X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X, and then add your plus C at the end. You can technically simplify this integral a little bit by having the integral of F of XDX equal to X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X divided by the natural log of A plus C. Essentially, in this integral, you just need to take the original A and X values from your logarithmic functions and plug them into the new function result. The way you get this integral is by using the change of base formula just like you did with derivatives. Remember, the goal of this formula is to change the base of your logarithm from A to B. As you could tell from the integral definition I just showed you, it uses the natural log of X divided by the natural log of A version of the proof, since the natural logarithm is usually the easiest to work with. Let's look at an example where F of X equals log base seven of X. And so in this case, your A is equal to seven. So using your formula, you have integral of F of XDX equals X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X, divide all that by the natural log of A plus C. So here you have your function integral of F of XDX equals the integral of log base seven of XDX, and that equals X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X. Divide all that by the natural log of A, which in this case is seven, and add C at the end with your plus C. Now let's look at the specific case for the natural logarithmic function, F of X equals the natural log of X. The formula to get the integral for F of X equals natural log of X is equal to the integral of F of XDX equals X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X plus C. The way you get this result is by using integration by parts. Let's look at an example using the natural logarithmic function. Here, you have F of X equals three multiplied by the natural log of X. So in this case, you could use the constant multiple rule, move the three out, and use your formula of the integral of F of XDX equals X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X plus C. And so this gets you a final result of the integral of F of XDX equals three multiplied by X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X plus C. Let's expand upon this example a little bit by adding some bounds to evaluate the integral. Let's say you want to evaluate the integral from the bounds between five and 10. So here you have your result, three multiplied by X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X, adding C, and again, you want to evaluate it from five to 10. So let's plug these numbers in. So this gets you three multiplied by 10 multiplied by the natural log of 10 minus 10. Subtract all that by three multiplied by five multiplied by the natural log of five minus five. This simplifies to 30 multiplied by the natural log of 10 minus 15 multiplied by the natural log of five minus 15, which is approximately equal to 29.936. Knowing how to work with logarithmic functions will help with more complex integrals you'll explore in the future. It is also amazing how the change of base formula and integration by parts helps simplify the process of finding these types of integrals. I suggest taking time on your own to review the different proofs for both of these integrals if you wish to learn more about them. Next up, let's take a look at inverse function integrals.

Inverse integrals (8 min 18 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's take a moment to look at integrals for inverse functions. Remember, inverse functions are essentially doing the reverse of the original function. Knowing how to deal with these integrals will be important in order to help you understand inverse trigonometric integrals. Let's say you have an inverse function of F to the negative one of X for your original function, F of X. In order to get the integral of that inverse function, F to the negative one of X for F of X, you have the integral of F to the negative one of X DX is equal to X multiplied by F to the negative one of X subtracted by the integral of F of F to the negative one of X DX plus C. Note that this only works if your original function F of X is invertible and integrable. This formula can be a bit difficult to understand at first with so many different pieces. Essentially, it is saying the integral of the inverse of your function F of X, is equal to X multiplied by your inverse function, subtracted by the integral of your function where it equals your inverse function. You can prove this formula by using integration by parts or by substitution. Let's look at a few examples to make more sense of how this formula works. So let's say you have the original function F of X equals X squared. And so, you know how to get this type of inverse function where it is simply F to the negative one of X is equal to X to the one half, or in this case that's the same as the square root of X. Remember, this is because the inverse function essentially undoes what the original function is doing. Let's begin by finding the integral of your original function F of X equals X squared. So you have the integral of F of X DX equals integral of X squared DX And using the power rule, this simply equals X to the third divided by three plus C. Now let's put this together with your inverse function formula. So you have the integral of F to the negative one of X DX is equal to X multiplied by F to the negative one of X subtracted by the integral of F of F to the negative one of X DX plus C. So this gets you X multiplied by X to the one half. Subtract that by X to the one half to the third divided by three plus C. Once you simplify this, you get a result of two thirds multiplied by X to the three halves plus C. Now let's prove the inverse function formula for integrals works by using the power rule to simply get the integral of the inverse function X to the one half. So, here, we're getting the integral of your inverse function, which is the integral of X to the one half DX. Using the power rule, you get X to the three halves and you'll divide that by three halves, which simplifies to two thirds multiplied by X to the three halves plus C, which again is the same result as you got prior. Let's take a look at another example. Let's say you have a function F of X equals five divided by X plus four, and you want to find the integral of the inverse of this function. First, let's find the inverse of the function itself. So the way you could do this is you could have Y equal to five divided by X plus four, and then you will solve for X. The way you simplify this is multiplying both sides by X plus four, dividing both sides by Y and then subtracting by four to get x equal to five divided by Y minus four. And then you can switch the Y and X to make things consistent, as far as the variables you're calculating on, to get you the inverse F to the negative one of X equals five divided by X minus four. Now that you have the inverse function, you can start by finding the integral of your original function F of X equals five divided by X plus four. Here, you will want to use the formula of the integral of one divided by A multiplied by X plus B DX equals one divided by A multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of A multiplied by X plus B plus C. So in this case, your A is equal to one and your B is equal to four, 'cause again, that five is seen more as a constant multiple. So the integral of F of X DX equals the integral of five divided by X plus four DX, which using your formula, is now equal to five multiplied by one, divided by one. Multiply that by the natural log, and then absolute values of one multiplied by X plus four. And again, add all that with plus C at the end. Once you simplify this a little bit, you get five multiplied by the natural log of absolute value of X plus four plus C. Now let's bring back in your inverse function integral to get the integral of F to the negative one of X DX equals X multiplied by the inverse function. So F to the negative one of X. Subtract that by the integral of F to the F to the negative one of X DX plus C. Now let's plug in your values. So you have X multiplied by five, divided by X minus four. Then you'll subtract five multiplied by the natural log. And again, absolute value signs. And then you'll have five divided by X minus four and then plus four. Again, still in that absolute value sign. And then, finally, you add your plus C at the end. If you simplify this a little bit, you'll get five minus four multiplied by X minus five, multiplied by the natural log of five divided by X plus C. And as you know with properties of logarithms, when you have things dividing in them, you can simply separate them out to be subtracting. Once you simplify this more, and again, multiply that minus five through the two versions of your natural log, you get a final result of five minus four multiplied by X minus five, multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of five plus five multiplied by the natural log absolute value of X plus C. Note that since C is an unknown constant and only the value of zero can integrate to a constant, then you can create what is called a new arbitrary constant, C prime, that equals your constant terms all added together. So in this case, you have C prime equal to five minus five multiplied by the natural log of five plus C. So this can simplify your final result to be the integral of your inverse function F to the negative one of X DX is equal to negative four multiplied by X plus five multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of X plus C prime, 'cause again, C prime is going to equal all those other constant value terms added together. The reason why this is great to have is this is the result you would get using other integration techniques. And again, the constant value can represent any value, so at the end of the day, you can essentially lump them all together. Let's look at one more example that applies to the exponential function F of X equals E to the X. As you've learned prior, the inverse of this function is the natural log of X, and then as you saw in a previous video, the integral of F of X DX is equal to the integral of E to the X DX, which is going to equal E to the X plus C. Let's plug this into your inverse integral formula. So you have the integral of F to the negative one of X DX is equal to X multiplied by F to the negative one of X. Subtract that by the integral of F of F to the negative one of X DX plus C. And this equals X multiplied by the natural log of X minus E to the natural log of X plus C. And as you know, E and natural log cancel each other out. So this simplifies to X multiplied by the natural log of X minus X plus C, which, as you saw, from the logarithmic integral video, this is the correct result for the natural log of X integral. Dealing with inverse derivatives can be a bit tricky at first, but they'll get easier as you continue to practice working on them. It is also a good reminder to keep working on learning either how to find or memorize inverse functions depending on the case. You'll expand what you learned in this video, and the trigonometric integral video you saw prior, in the next video, where I explain inverse trigonometric integrals.

Inverse trigonometric integrals (6 min 34 seconds)
- [Instructor] Now that you have learned about trigonometric integrals and inverse integrals, let's combine these two concepts together to learn about inverse trigonometric integrals. Note that these are for functions, such as cosine to the negative one of x, also known as arccosine, and they're not the same as, for example, one over cosine of x. These are the integrals for the six inverse trigonometric functions. So first, you have the integral of arcsine of x dx, which is equal to x multiplied by arcsine of x plus the square root of one minus x squared plus C. Next you have the integral of arccosine of x dx, which is equal to x multiplied by arccosine of x, subtract that by the square root of one minus x squared plus C. After that, you have the integral of arctangent of x dx, which is equal to x multiplied by arctangent of x, subtract that by 1/2 multiplied by the natural log of the absolute value of one plus x squared plus C. Next, you have the arccosecant of x dx, which is equal to x multiplied by arccosecant of x plus the natural log and the absolute value sign of x plus the square root of x squared minus one plus C. Then, you have the integral of arcsecant of x dx, which is equal to x multiplied by arcsecant of x, subtract that by the natural log of the absolute value sign of x plus the square root of x squared minus one plus C. And then finally, you have the integral of arccotangent of x dx, which is equal to x multiplied by the arccotangent of x plus 1/2 multiplied by the natural log absolute value signs of one plus x squared, and finally, plus C. As you can see, these integrals are very closely related to each other, just like their derivatives are. And again, this is due to the relationship of these types of functions. If you remember the derivatives of the six inverse trigonometric functions, note that you can get these inverse trigonometric functions by taking the integral of these values. So here are the integrals that have the six inverse trigonometric functions as their results. So if you take the integral of one divided by the square root of one minus x squared dx, this is equal to arcsine of x plus C. Next, you have the integral of negative one divided by the square root of one minus x squared dx, which is equal to the arccosine of x plus C. Next, you have the integral of one divided by one plus x squared dx, which is equal to arctangent of x plus C. After that, you have the integral of negative one divided by the absolute value of x multiplied by the square root of x squared minus one dx is equal to arccosecant of x plus C. Then, you have the integral of one divided by the absolute value of x multiplied by the square root of x squared minus one dx is equal to arcsecant of x plus C. And then finally, you have the integral of negative one divided by one plus x squared dx is equal to the arccotangent of x plus C. These integrals can be found and proven by implicit differentiation and techniques such as integration by parts. I highly recommend you memorize these six inverse trigonometric integrals, along with the integrals I just showed you that have the inverse trigonometric functions as their results, because that tends to be the easiest way to work with them. Let's look at a few examples of inverse trigonometric integrals in action. Let's start by showing how to get the integral for the function f of x equals five multiplied by arctangent of x plus arccosine of x. So here the integral of f of x dx is equal to the integral of five multiplied by arctangent of x plus arccosine of x dx. If you remember from what I showed you prior, the integral of arctangent of x dx is equal to x multiplied by arctangent of x, subtract that by 1/2 multiplied by the natural log of absolute value of one plus x squared plus C. And then, the integral of arccosine of x dx is equal to x multiplied by arccosine of x, subtract that by the square root of one minus x squared plus C. Now, you combine these two results together to get the integral of f of x dx is equal to five multiplied by a big chunk, which is x multiplied by arctangent of x minus 1/2 multiplied by the natural log of absolute value of one plus x squared. Now you move outside of those parentheses to get plus x multiplied by arccosine of x minus the square root of one minus x squared, and then finally, plus C. Once you simplify this, you get a final result of five multiplied by x multiplied by arctangent of x, subtract that by 5/2 multiplied by natural log of absolute value of one plus x squared, and then add x multiplied by arccosine of x, and then subtract that by the square root of one minus x squared, and finally, plus C. Let's look at another example where you have the function f of x equals one divided by one plus x squared, subtract that by one divided by the square root of one minus x squared. So if you remember from prior, the integral of one divided by one plus x squared dx is equal to arctangent of x plus C. For the next piece, you have the integral of one divided by the square root of one minus x squared dx, which is equal to arcsine of x plus C. If you combine these two results together and subtract them, you get a final result for your integral of f of x dx is equal to arctangent of x minus arcsine of x plus C. Like I mentioned before, the best way to learn inverse trigonometric integrals is to memorize the integrals for each of the six functions along with when those six functions are the results of integrals. I recommend taking time on your own to continue practicing how to get these integrals of these functions and to take a look at the proofs of how to get these integrals in the first place if you are interested in how they work. In the last video for this chapter, I will expand on integrating trigonometric functions by showing you how to work with hyperbolic integrals.

Hyperbolic integrals (5 min 1 second)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up this chapter by exploring hyperbolic integrals. Remember, hyperbolic functions are similar to trigonometric functions, but they are defined using a hyperbola instead of a unit circle. These types of functions are not as common to work with as the other ones you explore in this course, but it is good to know their integrals in case they do come up in your future work. The following are the integrals for the six hyperbolic functions. So you have the integral of sine H of XDX is equal to cosine H of X plus C. Then you have the integral of cosine H of XDX is equal to sine H of X plus C. Then you have the integral of tangent H of XDX is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of cosine H of X plus C. Then you have the integral of cosecant H of XDX is equal to the natural log of tangent H of X divided by two, and again, those are an absolute value signs, plus C. After that, you have the integral of secant H of XDX is equal to arc tangent of sine H of X plus C, and then finally you have the integral of cotangent H of XDX is equal to the natural log of absolute value of sine of H of X plus C. You'll notice these six integrals look very similar to your typical trigonometric integrals with a few minor changes in the process. These six hyperbolic integrals are found using exponential and hyperbolic properties. Like with the other trigonometric function integrals I highly recommend you memorize these six hyperbolic integrals since that tends to be the easiest way to work with them. Let's look at a few examples of hyperbolic integrals in action. Let's start off by showing how to get the integral for the function F of X equals sine H of X minus cotangent H of X. As you saw before, the integral of sine H of XDX is equal to cosine H of X plus C, and the integral of cotangent H of XDX is equal to the natural log of sine H of X plus C. If you combine these together, you get your integral of F of XDX is equal to the integral of sine H of X minus cotangent H of XDX is equal to cosine H of X minus the natural log of absolute value of sine H of X plus C. Let's look at another example that's a little bit more complicated. Let's look at the function F of X equals secant H of X multiplied by tangent H of X. If you remember from a video I showed you in a prior chapter, the function secant H of X is equal to one divided by cosine H of X and tangent H of X is equal to sign H of X divided by cosine H of X. Again, this is similar to their counterpart trigonometric functions. So here if you get the integral of F of XDX, which is equal to the integral of secant H of X multiplied by the tangent H of XDX, this is the same as saying you want to get the integral of one divided by cosine H of X multiplied by sine H of X divided by cosine H of XDX, which is equal to the integral of sine H of X divided by cosine H squared of XDX. Let's use the substitution method to get this integral. So in this case, you'll have U equal to cosine H of X and DU equal to sine H of XDX. So in this case, that means your function is equal to the integral of one divided by U squared DU. Using the power rule, the result for this is simply negative one divided by U plus C. So if you sub in U equals cosine H of X, you get a result of negative one divided by cosine H of X plus C, which again, as you saw prior, is equal to negative secant H of X plus C for your final result. Note that there are many scenarios like the last example that contain different combinations of hyperbolic functions. I will not review those in this course since there are dozens of them, but I highly recommend taking time on your own to look them up and explore them. Like I mentioned before, the best way to learn hyperbolic integrals is to memorize the integrals for each of the six functions. I recommend taking time on your own to continue practicing getting integrals for these types of functions, along with making sure you have those six integrals memorized. Remember, these functions are not as common as the other ones you have worked with throughout the rest of this course, but they're good to know in case you do encounter them in the future. This wraps up how to work with many common integrals for various functions. As you saw throughout the chapter, it is a mix of learning new techniques, using integration rules and memorization. Remember, practice is what will help continue to solidify the knowledge you are learning throughout this course. In the next chapter, you'll continue exploring what you could do with integrals by learning about complex integrals.

Day 14
Complex integrals
Numerical integration (10 min 6 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this chapter, you will explore some complex integrals and integration techniques. You will first review some techniques you can use when the previous ones you learned are not a good option. Then you will explore double and triple integrals. Let's start off with numerical integration. Numerical integration is a class of methods to calculate the integral of a function by providing an approximate value. These techniques are great to use when it is difficult or impossible to find the integral using the previous techniques you learned. You will explore three numerical integration techniques. These include the midpoint, trapezoidal, and Simpson's rules. Let's begin by looking at the midpoint rule. The midpoint rule allows you to use a Riemann sum with subintervals of equal width and midpoints to estimate an integral. The formula is represented by capital MN equals the sum of i=1 to N of f of mi multiplied by upper delta of X. So the upper delta is the little triangle. Your upper delta X is equal to b minus a divided n, where you have your function f of x on the interval a,b with the number of subintervals equaling n. And finally, you have the midpoint of each subinterval, which is represented by m of i. Let's see the midpoint rule in an example. Let's look at the interval of 0,1 of e to the negative x squared multiplied by cosine of xdx. In this case. you have the interval between 0 and 1, and let's divide it into four subintervals. If you do this, you get four sub intervals of zero to 0.25, 0.25 to 0.5, 0.5 to 0.7.5, and 0.75 to 1. If you get the midpoints for each of these subintervals, which is the middle point in between each of them, you'll then get m of 1 equals 0.125, m of 2 equals 0.375m, m of 3 equals 0.625, and finally, m of 4 equals 0.875. Let's use your formula, capital M of n equals the sum of i equals 1 to N of f of mi multiplied by your upper delta X. Let's calculate your upper delta X first to get b minus a divided by n, which is equal to 1 minus 0 for your interval divided by four, which is the number of subintervals you have. This gets you 1/4. Now let's plug in your values. This gets you capital M of n equals 1/4 multiplied by your four midpoints evaluated at those different parts of the function. So you have f of 0.125 plus f of 0.375 plus f of 0.625 plus f of 0.875. Let's plug in your function. f of X equals 8 to the negative x squared multiplied by cosine of x. This gets you capital M of n equals 1/4 multiplied by e to the negative 0.125 squared multiplied by cosine of 0.125 plus e to the negative 0.375 squared multiplied by cosine of 0.375. And then on the next line, you'll have plus e to the negative 0.625 squared multiplied by cosine of 0.625 plus e to the negative 0.875 squared multiplied by cosine of 0.875. Once you calculate this out and round it to four decimal places, you'll get capital M of n equals 1/4 multiplied by 0.9760 plus 0.8149 plus 0.5441 plus 0.3617. Once you combine this and multiply it by 1/4, you then get the integral of 0,1 of e to the negative X squared multiplied by cosine of xdx is approximately equal to 0.6742. Next step up the trapezoidal rule. This rule is very closely related to the midpoint rule. The trapezoidal rule allows you to gather an approximate value of an integral by summing trapezoids instead of rectangles. The formula of this rule is given by capital T of n equals 1/2 multiplied by upper delta of x multiplied by f of x0 plus 2 multiplied by f of x1 plus 2 multiplied by f of x2 plus all the way to plus 2 multiplied by f of XN minus 1 plus f of xn. Your upper delta X is still given by b minus a divided by n, and you'll still have your function f of x on your interval of a,b, with your number of subintervals equal to n. And in this case, you have what are called partition points, represented by the xi. Let's use the trapezoidal rule to compute the interval of 0,1 of A to the negative x squared dx. In this case, you still have your interval of 0,1, and let's use four subintervals again, This time you'll have your X of 0 equals 0, x of 1 equals 0.25, x of 2 equals 0.5, x of 3 equals 0.75, and x of 4 equals 1. Note that this time you start out with that X0 term, and so that is going to be the very start of your interval. So even though there are four subintervals, you'll be actually getting five partition points. So let's use your equation, capital T of n equals 1/2 multiplied by upper delta of x multiplied by f of x0 plus 2 multiplied by f of x1 plus 2 multiplied by f of x2 plus all the way to plus 2 multiplied by f of Xn minus 1 plus f of xn. So your upper delta X is still equal to b minus a divided by N, which is equal to 1 minus 0 divided by 4, which equals 1/4 Let's plug this into your equation to get capital T of n equals 1/2 multiplied by 1/4 multiplied by f of 0 plus 2 multiplied by F of 0.25 plus 2 multiplied by f of 0.5 plus 2 multiplied by t of 0.75 plus f of 1. Let's plug in your function. f of x equals e to the negative x squared. This time, you'll get capital T of n equals 1/8 multiplied by e to the negative zero squared plus 2 multiplied by e to the negative 0.25 squared plus 2 multiplied by e to the negative 0.5 squared plus 2 multiplied by e to the negative 0.75 squared plus e to the negative one squared. Once you solve these different exponents and simplify them by rounding to four decimal places, you'll then get capital T of n equals 1/8 multiplied by one plus 1.8788 plus 1.5576 plus 1.1396 plus 0.3679. So this means your integral of 0,1 of e to the negative x squared dx is approximately equal to 0.7430. The last technique you'll explore is Simpson's rule. This rule is named after British mathematician Thomas Simpson. It is similar to the trapezoidal rule, but this time, it will have improved accuracy. This rule estimates an integral by summing parabolic segments instead of straight line approximations. In this course, you'll use a version of this rule called Simpson's 1/3 rule. This rule is given by the formula capital S of n equals b minus a divided by x multiplied by f of a plus 4 multiplied by f of a plus b divided by 2 plus f of b. So you have your function f of x, and your interval from a,b. Let's use this in an example. Let's get the integral of 0 to pi of sin of x squared dx. Note that the squared part is within the sine function. Let's look at this on the interval of 0,pi, so using your formula, you have capital S of n equals b minus a divided by X multiplied by f of a plus 4 multiplied by f of a plus b divided by 2 plus f of b. In this case, your a is 0 and your b is pi. So let's solve the outer fraction to get b minus a divided by 6 equals pi minus zero divided by 6, which just equals PI divided by 6. Let's plug in your bounds to get capital S of n equals pi of 6 multiplied by f of 0 plus 4 multiplied by f of 0 plus pi divided by 2 plus f of pi. Plugging in your function, you then get capital S of n equals pi divided by 6 multiplied by sine of 0 plus 4 multiplied by sine of pi squared divided by 4, since you need to square both the top and bottom of that fraction, and then finally plus sine of pi squared. Once you solve this, you then get the integral of 0,pi of sine of x squared dx is approximately equal to 1.1266. Note that for any of the examples, you can round it to whatever decimal place makes the most sense to you. But again, just note that the fewer decimal points you have as you're going along, the more likely you are to have some sort of rounding error. This should give you a good idea of how you can estimate integrals in cases where it is extremely difficult or impossible to solve them using traditional analytical techniques. Up next, let's review what complex functions are and how to integrate them.

Complex function integrals (6 min 12 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's start off by exploring complex function integrals. Note that this video, and the two following theorem videos, will all be highly connected. Let's start with learning what complex functions are. A complex function involves complex numbers as inputs and outputs. These types of functions operate on what is called a complex plane. This plane represents complex numbers plotted, using a Cartesian coordinate system. This complex plane contains the input and output values with both the real and imaginary parts. A complex integral integrates a complex function F of C, along a path capital C in a complex plane. This is different than a typical integral where you would integrate along a real line. This path is called the contour, hence why these integrals are often referred to as contour integrals. There are two common ways to notate a contour integral, or again, a complex function integral. The first format is where you'll have the integral, and then you'll have a circle in the middle of the integration sign, and then you'll have your capital C for your complex plane, represented on the bottom right of that integral sign. And then you'll have that for F of ZDZ. The second format that you'll often see is the integral with just upper gamma in the bottom right of it, and then you'll have F of Z, DZ. You'll use the first notation in this course, but note that again, these are the two main formats you'll see when looking at other resources. There are various methods you can use to compute these types of integrals, and it starts off if they are contour integrals over open or close curves. Contour integrals over open curves take the integral over a finite curve, connecting two points in a complex playing capital C. Note that this will cause the complex function integral to have slightly different notation. So for example, you have the integral of Z one to Z two of F of Z DZ. Contour integrals over close curves take the integral over a closed path, also known as a loop in a complex plane capital C. So note the two different notations depending on if it's an open curve versus a closed curve that you are integrating over. Let's first take a look at the case where you have an open curve. If the contour capital C can be parameterized as Z of T for A less than or equal to T, less than or equal to B, then you can compute the integral with the following formula. So you have the integral of C of F of Z, DZ, equals the integral of A to B of F of C of T of DZ DT, DT. Note that this is the easier of the two types of integrals calculate between the open and closed curves. Let's look at an example of this. Let's evaluate the contour integral along the straight line path of zero to I plus one of Z squared DZ. So in this case, you'll use your formula integral C of F of Z DZ is equal to the integral of A to B of F of Z of T, DZ DT, DT. In this case, your Z of T is equal to T multiplied by one plus I for values of T between zero and one. This is what happens when you parameterize your contour. Now let's get the derivative of this. So DZ is simply equal to I plus one of DT. Let's plug this in using your formula to get the integral of zero to one of T multiplied by one plus I, and square all of that, and then multiply that by one plus I DT. This simplifies to the integral of zero to one of T squared, multiplied by one plus I, and cube that set, DT. And in this case, one plus I cubed, is equal to negative two plus two, multiplied by I. So you can then move this outside your integral to get negative two plus two, multiplied by I, multiplied by the integral of zero to one of T squared DT. This gets you negative two plus two multiplied by I, multiplied by T cubed divided by three, evaluated from zero to one. Once you evaluate this, you get negative two plus two, multiplied by I, plus one cubed, divided by three, subtracted by negative two plus two multiplied by I, multiplied by zero cubed divided by three. This gets you a result of negative two thirds plus two thirds multiplied by I. If you are integrating a complex function integral over a close curve, then there are two main cases to consider. If your complex function F of Z is homomorphic, meaning there are no singularities inside of your complex plane, capital C, then you will use Cauchy's theorem with Cauchy's integral formula to solve it. If your complex function F of Z is neuromorphic, which means it's homomorphic except for isolated singularities inside the complex plane, capital C, then you'll use the residue theorem to solve your contour integral. There are various practical applications for complex function integrals. In probability, they're used in complex valued probability distributions. In physics, they're used in electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. And in engineering, they're used in stability analysis and control systems and signal processing. This should give you an idea of what complex function integrals are, and some methods on how to solve them. You'll focus on using Cauchy's theorem and the residue theorem in the following two videos to solve contour integrals over closed curves. Let's start by exploring Cauchy's Theorem.

Cauchy’s theorem (5 min 39 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned that there are two main methods when solving contour integrals with closed curves. In this video, you'll focus on using Cauchy's Theorem. Let's first review what this theorem is. This is what Cauchy's Theorem states. Let f of z be a complex function that is holomorphic, meaning it is complex differentiable and it has no singularities in a simple connected domain, capital D. If capital C is a simple closed contour lying entirely within D, then you have the complex function integral of f of z dz equals zero. This means the contour integral of f of z around any closed curve, capital C in a simply connected domain is equal to zero. So how does this theorem work? A simply connected domain is where any close curve can be continuously deformed to a point without leaving the domain. If a function is holomorphic in a domain, then any closed loop integral within that domain must vanish. This is similar to the fundamental theorem of calculus where the integral of a derivative over a closed integral cancels out. Cauchy's Theorem is what creates Cauchy's integral formula to allow you to calculate contour integrals on closed curves. So if you have a holomorphic complex function, f of z over a closed contour, capital C, enclosing z naught, then you have the following formula. f of z naught equals one divided by two, multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, and then you'll multiply that by the contour integral of f of z divided by z minus z naught dz. Let's use Cauchy's integral formula in a few examples. Let's say you want to solve the contour integral of e to z divided by z minus one dz. In this case, capital C is the circle, absolute value of z equal to two. You can check that the function f of z equals e to the z is holomorphic everywhere. Remember, this means that it is complex differentiable and it has no singularities. The denominator z minus one suggests that you have a simple poll at z equals one. Since z equals one is inside the contour of absolute value of z equals two, you can then use the following formula. So you have your formula f of z naught equals one divided by two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by your contour integral of f of z divided by z minus z naught dz. You can then rearrange this formula to get the contour interval of f of z over z minus z naught dz is equal to two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by f of z naught. Now let's plug in your values to get the contour integral of e to z over z minus one dz is equal to two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by e to the one. This is because your z naught in this case is one. So this gets you a final result of two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by e. Let's look at another example. Let's solve the contour integral z squared plus three multiplied by z plus two divided by z minus two dz. This time, capital C is the circle absolute value of z equal to three. You could check on your own that f of z equals z squared plus three multiplied by z plus two is holomorphic. Your denominator z minus two implies that there is a single poll at z equals two. So you could check that z equals two is inside the absolute value of z equals three. So let's use your formula f of z naught equals one divided by two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i. Multiply that by the contour integral of f of z divided by z minus z naught dz. Rearranging your formula again, you get the contour integral of f of z divided by z minus z naught dz is equal to two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by f of z naught. In this case your z naught equals two. So let's find what f of two should be. So in this case, f of two is equal to z squared plus three multiplied by z plus two, which plugging in your value of z naught gets you two squared plus three multiplied by two plus two. So now you know that f of two equals 12. Plugging this into your contour integral, you get the contour integral of z squared plus three multiplied by z plus two divided by z minus two is equal to two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by 12, which gets you a final result of 24 multiplied by pi, multiplied by i. As you could tell, once you understand the terminology and how to work with complex functions, this theorem is fairly easy and straightforward to use, especially with the integral formula that corresponds with it. The main part is ensuring you check if the complex function is holomorphic before proceeding. In the next video, you'll review the other method to solve contour integrals with closed curves, the Residue Theorem.

Residue theorem (6 min 51 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned how to use Cauchy's theorem to solve contour integrals with closed curves. But what happens if your complex function contains singularities? This is where the residue theorem shines. Let's first review what this theorem is. This is what the residue theorem states. Let f of z be a function that is meromorphic, meaning it is holomorphic except for isolated singularities, and this is going to be on a simple closed contour C in the complex plane. Suppose f of z has a finite number of isolated singularities notated by z1, z2, all the way to zn, and this will be inside of C. Then the contour integral is given by the contour integral of f of z over z minus z nought dz is equal to two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by the sum of k equals one to n of the residues of (f,zk). Let's review the contour integral for f of z with the residue theorem. So looking at your formula that you just reviewed, you first have the singularities of z1, z2 to zn, and then you have your residue, which is represented by the R and then es and (f,zk), so that'll be the residue f of zk, and this represents the coefficient one divided by z minus zk in the Laurent series expansion of f of z around zk. So how does this theorem work? Instead of directly computing the contour integral, you're going to find the residues at the singularities and multiply it by two, multiplied by pi, multiplied by i. This generalizes Cauchy's theorem, where the non-zero contributions come from the singularities inside of C. So how do you find these elusive residues? The residue at a singularity zK is found by, number one, if f of z has a simple pole zk, then the the residue is the residue of f,ck equals the limit as x approaches zk of z minus zk multiplied by f of z. Number two, if f of z has a pole of order m at zk, then the residue is given by the residue of f of zk equals one, divided by m minus one factorial, multiplied by the limit as x approaches zk with the derivative of d to the m minus one over d multiplied by z to the m minus one, and this will be for z minus ck, taken to the m, multiplied by f of z. Number three, if f of z is expanded as a Laurent series formatted as f of z equals the sum of n equals negative infinity to infinity of a of n multiplied by z minus zk to the n, then the residue at zk is a minus one. And note that this is not a minus one, but a of minus one. Let's use this in a few examples. Let's solve the contour integral of one divided by z minus two dz. In this case, you have a closed contour enclosing z equals two with a simple pole. So using the first option, you'll have the residue of f of zk equals limit as x approaches zk of z minus zk multiplied by f of z. Plugging in your values, you get the residue of f of two equals the limit as x approaches two of z minus two, and then you'll multiply by your numerator, which is your function, which is just one, so in this case, it equals one. So using your theorem, you get the contour integral of f of z divided by z minus z nought dz is equal to two, multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by the sum of k equals one to n of the residue of f and zk. Let's plug in your values to get the contour integral of one divided by z minus two dz equals two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i, multiplied by one, which just gets you two multiplied by pi, multiplied by i. Let's look at another example, and let's solve the contour integral of z plus two divided by z minus one to the third dz. In this case, you have a higher order pole of z equals one of order three. So using the second option to find the residue, you have the residue of f of zk equals one divided by m minus one factorial multiplied by the limit as x approaches zk of d to the m minus one over d, multiplied by z to the m minus one, and that'll be for z minus z of k to the m, multiplied by f of z. Plugging in your values, you get the residue of f one equals one divided by three minus one factorial multiplied by the limit as x approaches one of d to the three minus one divided by d of z to the three minus one, and you'll multiply that by z to the minus one cubed, multiplied by z plus two, divided by z minus one cubed. Simplifying this, you get the residue of (f,1) equals one half multiplied by the limit as x approaches one of d squared over dz squared, multiplied by z plus two since you're z minus one cubed cancels out. So in this case, let's find the second derivative of this. So your first derivative is d dz of z plus two, which equals one, and then if you take the second derivative of that, you get d squared over dc squared of one, which equals zero. So your residue f of one equals one half multiplied by the limit as x approaches one of zero, which equals one half multiplied by zero, which gets you just zero as your result. So the final result for your contour integral of z plus two over z minus one cubed dz is equal to zero. Note that you could technically use the third option of the Laurent series expansion on this example as well to get that same result. It is great seeing how you can use the residue theorem to solve contour integrals that contain singularities with closed curves. In the next video, you'll pivot topics and explore another form of advanced integrals and how to calculate them starting with double integrals.

Double integrals (8 min 36 seconds)
- [Instructor] In the last few chapters, you learn what an integral is, and how to calculate it. But you may be wondering, what is a higher order integral? Let's dive into a definition of exactly what higher order integrals are. A higher order integral is when you take the integral of a function, multiple times. So instead of just integrating a function once, you may integrate that original function, then integrate the result of that first integral, and then repeat that as many times as needed. Let's start off by exploring double integrals. A double integral is when you take an integral two times in succession. Essentially, it is doing the same thing twice. It is notated by two integral signs next to each other. One thing to note is usually when you do a double integral, you'll usually have two different variables, you are integrating on, such as X and Y within your integral. So the way this is notated is usually, you have your function F of X comma Y instead of just F of X, and then the format for the double integral is, two integral signs right next to each other, and then you have F of XY, and then you'll have DX and DY since again, you're integrating both on X and Y in the process. Double integrals generally have the same properties as regular single integrals do, and they generally function the same. Essentially, instead of just integrating once, you're just going to be integrating twice. Note that this is a bit of a simplification for this course to teach you the general idea of how to work with double integrals, but they do tend to be a bit more complicated when defining their properties. Also, you generally tend to take definite double integrals instead of indefinite double integrals, since the indefinite ones can get a bit complicated. One important theorem I will mention before I proceed is Fubini's theorem. Fubini's theorem states if your function F of X comma Y is continuous over a rectangular region R, defined by A less than or equal to X, less than or equal to B and C less than or equal to Y, less than or equal to D, then your double integral of R of F of X comma Y, DX DA is going to be equal to the integral of A to B, Integral C to D of F of X comma Y, DY DX, is equal to the integral of C to D, integral A to B of F of X comma Y, DX DY. Essentially, this means you could break down the double integral into two single integrals to solve and evaluate to simplify your calculations. You'll also note that you can switch the order, and it doesn't necessarily matter as long as your variables are matching your bounds. So you may be wondering, what exactly does a double integral measure in the first place? Double integrals usually measure volume under a surface area of a region, or the average value of a function over a plane region. They can also be used in rectangular regions, other general plane regions, and with polar coordinates in a more circular context. For this video, I will focus on a simple example in a rectangular region. Let's look at an example of how double integrals work. So let's say you have the function F of X comma Y, Y equals four, multiplied by X to the seventh, plus eight multiplied by Y cubed. And let's say you have your bounds of X between zero and two and Y between one and three. So here, you have your double integral of F of X comma Y, DX DY, is equal to the integral of one to three, integral zero to two of four, multiplied by X to the seventh, plus eight multiplied by Y cubed, DX, DY. And so you'll notice the outer integral of one to three has your DY, and your inner integral of zero to two has DX. So again, make sure that your bounds and your DX DY are matching. Note that you should be able to integrate this function with respect to X or Y first. In this case, we will do with respect to X first. Remember, you can use Fubini's theorem to separate out these integrals to make them easier to calculate, and again, switch the order if needed. Let's begin by taking the integral with respect to X and separating the integral, using the sum rule. So let's get the integral from zero to two of four, multiplied by X to the seventh DX. So this gets you a result of four multiplied by one eighth, multiplied by X to the eighth, which simplifies to X to the eighth divided by two. If you evaluate this from zero to two, you get two to the eighth divided by two, minus zero to the eighth divided by two, which equals 256 divided by two, which is equal to 128. Next comes a little bit trickier part. So here, you're integrating from zero to two of eight, multiplied by Y cubed DX. Now again, this time, you're integrating with respect to X, so in a way, you kind of ignore that eight Y cubed, and then you just act like you're integrating one DX. So your result for this is going to be eight multiplied by Y cubed, multiplied by X. And again, you're still going to evaluate that from zero to two. So here, you have eight multiplied by Y cubed, multiplied by two. Subtract all that by eight, multiplied by Y cubed, multiplied by zero to get your result of 16 multiplied by Y cubed. So your first integral from zero to two of four multiplied by X to the seventh plus eight multiplied by Y cubed DX is equal to 128 plus 16, multiplied by Y cubed. This is how your results should be, since you should have all your X variables integrated out and evaluated so that you're just left in this case with your Y variable to integrate on. Now let's evaluate the next part of the integral with respect to DY. So here, you have the integral from one to three of 128 plus 16, multiplied by Y cubed DY. You can separate this out again, using the sum rule. So you have the integral of one to three of 128 DY, which is equal to 128 multiplied by Y, evaluated from one to three, which is 128 multiplied by three, minus 128 multiplied by one, which equals 256. Next, let's evaluate the integral of one to three of 16 multiplied by Y cubed DY, which is equal to 16 multiplied by one fourth multiplied by Y to the fourth, using the power rule. Simplify this to get four multiplied by Y to the fourth. Evaluate it from one to three. So this gets you four, multiplied by three to the fourth. Subtract that by a four, multiplied by one to the fourth, which equals 320. So this means your integral between one to three of 128 plus 16, multiplied by Y cubed DY, is equal to 256 plus 320, which gives you a result of 576. So this means the final result for your double integral of one to three integral is zero to two of four multiplied by X to the seventh plus eight multiplied by Y cubed DX DY is equal to 576. You may be wondering why you need to do a double integral in the first place. Like I mentioned earlier, double integrals are very helpful when measuring volume under a surface area of a region, or the average value of a function. In physics, double integrals are used for a variety of calculations such as center of mass and moments of inertia. In probability, they are used in joint probability density functions. And finally, in engineering, they're used in wave functions along with image and signal processing. Once you understand the concept of double integrals, any integrals with the higher order are fairly straightforward with simple repetition. This is similar to higher order derivatives where again, you basically just keep doing the same thing over and over. Note that this course just scratches the surface of double integrals, since they often take many weeks of content in a regular advanced university calculus course. Feel free to continue exploring double integrals more on your own, though. Up next, you'll continue to expand upon this concept by exploring triple integrals.

Triple integrals (7 min 53 seconds)
- [Trainer] Once you learn the concept of double integrals, any integrals at the higher order are fairly straightforward to learn. Essentially, you just keep repeating the same process as many times as needed. In this video, you will explore triple integrals. A triple integral is when you take an integral three times in succession. Essentially, it is just doing the same thing three times in a row. It is notated by three integral signs next to each other. One thing to note is usually when you do a triple integral, you have three different variables you are integrating on such as X, Y, and Z within your integral. So then your format for your triple integral is you have three integral signs, and then you have F of X, Y, Z, and then you have DXDYDZ. To keep things simple for this course, you can assume the properties for single and double integrals apply to triple integrals. Triple integrals bring you to three dimensions. They can be used in a variety of ways, such as measuring volume, force, or mass in a 3D region, along with finding the average value over three variables. Triple integrals can also be used in general 3D regions, cylindrical or spherical regions, and with plane projections. For this video, I will focus on a simple example to show you the process of working through a triple integral. Let's solve the triple integral for the function F of X, Y, Z equals six multiplied by X to the fifth plus four multiplied by Y cubed plus two multiplied by Z. In this case, you'll have X be between zero and one, Y between zero and two, and Z between zero and three. So your triple integral of F of X, Y, Z, DXDYDZ is equal to the integral of zero to three, integral zero to two, integral zero to one, six multiplied by X to the fifth plus four multiplied by Y cubed plus two multiplied by ZDXDYDZ. Again, note with Fubini's theorem that you should be able to separate out these integrals to integrate them. And again, you can put them in whatever order you want, just like as you see here, making sure that your X, Y, and Z bounds are matching appropriately with the DX, DY, and DZ. Let's begin by taking the integral with respect to X, and you can separate this integral out using the sum rule. So here you have the integral of zero to one of six multiplied by X to the fifth DX, which is equal to six multiplied by one sixth multiplied by X to the sixth using the power rule, which simplifies to just X to the sixth between zero and one. So if you evaluate this, you get one to the sixth minus zero to the sixth, which equals one. Next, you have your integral from zero to one of four multiplied by Y cubed DX, which equals four multiplied by Y cubed, multiplied by X from zero to one. Like with double integrals, again, when you're integrating on other variables, essentially you just act like you're integrating on one. Once you evaluate this, you get four multiplied by Y cubed multiplied by one. Subtract that by four multiplied by Y cubed multiplied by zero, and that gets you a result of four multiplied by Y cubed. Finally, you have the integral of zero to one of two multiplied by ZDX. Again, basically like you're integrating on the value of one. This gets you a result of two multiplied by Z multiplied by X, evaluated from zero to one, which is two multiplied by Z multiplied by one minus two multiplied by Z multiplied by zero, which equals two multiplied by Z. So this means your first integral from zero to one of six multiplied by X to the fifth plus four multiplied by Y cubed plus two multiplied by ZDX is equal to one plus four multiplied by Y cubed plus two multiplied by Z. Now let's evaluate the integral with respect to Y. So here you get zero to two of one plus four multiplied by Y cubed plus two multiplied by ZDY. Remember, you could separate this out using the sum rule. So first, your integral from zero to two of 1DY is simply equal to Y. Evaluate that from zero to two equals two minus zero, which is simply two. Next, you have the integral from zero to two of four multiplied by Y cubed DY, which equals four multiplied by one divided by four, multiplied by Y to the fourth, which equals Y to the fourth, evaluated from zero to two. This equals two to the fourth minus zero to the fourth, which equals 16. And then finally, you have your integral from zero to two of two multiplied by ZDY, which again, it's like integrating on one. So you have a result of two multiplied by Z multiplied by Y, evaluated from zero to two, which is two multiplied by Z multiplied by two, subtract that by two, multiplied by Z multiplied by zero, which equals four multiplied by Z. This means the result of your second integral of zero to two of one plus four multiplied by Y cubed plus two multiplied by ZDY is equal to two plus 16 plus four multiplied by Z, which is equal to 18 plus four multiplied by Z. Finally, let's evaluate your last integral with respect to Z. So you have the integral of zero to three of 18 plus four multiplied by ZDZ. Let's separate this out again using the sum rule. So you have the integral of zero to three of 18DZ is equal to 18 multiplied by Z, evaluated from zero to three, which is 18 multiplied by three minus 18 multiplied by zero, which equals 54. Next, you have the integral of zero to three of four multiplied by ZDZ, which equals four multiplied by one half, multiplied by Z squared, which equals two multiplied by Z squared, evaluated from zero to three. And this equals two multiplied by three squared minus two multiplied by zero squared, which equals 18. So your integral of zero to three of 18 plus four multiplied by ZDZ is equal to 54 plus 18, which gives you a result of 72. This means your final result for your triple integral of zero to three, zero to two, and zero to one of six multiplied by X to the fifth plus four multiplied by Y cubed plus two multiplied by ZDXDYDZ is equal to 72. So why would you need to take a triple integral in the first place? Like I mentioned earlier, these integrals are important to measure volume, force, and mass in a 3D region, along with finding the average value over three variables. They can be used in engineering to calculate electric and magnetic field intensities. They can also be used to model heat distribution in a 3D object in physics. Like I mentioned before, once you understand the concept of double integrals, any integrals such as triple integrals that are a higher order are fairly straightforward with simple repetition. Note that this course just scratches the surface of triple integrals, since again, like with double integrals, they often take up many weeks of content in a regular advanced calculus university course. But as always, you are welcome to continue exploring this concept more on your own. This wraps up your introduction to complex integrals, but note that this is just the beginning. I suggest you take time on your own to continue exploring these topics, since again, they're often taught in an advanced calculus university course and usually have a whole course dedicated to them and various other advanced concepts. In the next chapter, you will learn about some common integral applications.

Integral applications
Area between curves (6 min 47 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up this course by exploring multiple applications for integrals. Not only can you use integrals to find the area under the curve, but there are various other applications in a wide variety of industries. The applications you will explore are area between curves, volume, average value of a function, arc length, surface area, force, work, and energy, masses and moments, and probability. Let's start off with finding the area between curves. So far, you have learned how to compute integrals to find the area beneath the curve of a function. This will usually be between the function and the X-axis. But what do you do if there are two functions created in an area? This is where you can expand upon your knowledge of integrals to find the area between curves. So for example in this graph, you have a blue line representing one function, which is a parabola. So it looks like a U. And then you have a red line representing another function, which is a straight line through Y equals four. So, you are looking at the shaded blue area where it is going to be the area between these two curves. You can calculate the area between curves by integrating over the difference between the two functions that make up the curve boundaries. You can do this in terms of X or Y, and often you will have designated bounds you will integrate over. Let's look at the formulas for the area between curves. Let F of X and G of X be continuous functions, such that F of X is greater than or equal to G of X over the close bounded interval A to B. The area for the given region between the two functions and its bounds is given by capital A equals the integral of A to B of F of X minus G of X DX. Now let's look at another version of this formula. Let F of Y and G of Y be continuous functions, such that F of Y is greater than or equal to G of Y over the closed bounded interval A to B. The area for the given region is capital A equals the integral of A to B of F of Y minus G of Y DY. In the two formulas you saw in the previous slide, the first one is when you were integrating the upper curve subtracted by the lower curve. So this is done in terms of X. The second one is when you're integrating the right curve subtracted by the left curve, and this is done in terms of Y. Sometimes you may need to find the intersection points of the two functions to integrate over. In this case, you will equal F of X equals G of X, or F of Y equals G of Y and solve to get X or Y accordingly to gather bounds for your integral. Let's start with finding the area between the functions of F of X equals the square root of X and G of X equals X squared between the values of zero and one. You can look at them graphically, where you have the graph of F of X equals the square root of X notated by the blue line that starts at X equals zero and slightly goes up into the right. And then you have G of X equals X squared, which is represented by the red line. So it's a parabola, making a U-shape. And what you want to find is the area between these two curves between zero and one. So that'll get you the shaded region between those two curves. In this case, you'll integrate capital A equals the integral of A to B of F of X minus G of X DX. This will be getting the upper function subtracted by the lower function. Substituting in your functions and balance, you get the integral of zero to one of the square root of X minus X squared DX. Once you solve this integral, you'll get two-thirds multiplied by X to the three-halves minus one-third multiplied by X cubed plus C evaluated from zero to one. Once you plug in your bounds, your constant of integration C will drop. So then you'll have two-thirds multiplied by one to the three-halves minus one-third multiplied by one cubed, and then you'll subtract all of that by two-thirds multiplied by zero to the three-halves minus one-third multiplied by zero cubed. This will then equal two-thirds minus one-third minus zero, which equals one-third. So, that will be the area between those two curves for your functions F of X equals the square root of X and G of X equals X squared between the values of zero and one. Onto another example, but this time let's find the area with functions of Y. So in this case, you'll have F of Y equals E to the Y and G of Y equals one plus Y squared. This will also be between the bounds of zero and one, but this time it is in terms of Y. So it'll be Y equals zero to Y equals one. In this graph, you'll notice you have your two curves of F of Y equals E to the Y, which is represented by the blue curve starting way from the bottom and then coming up. And then you also have one plus Y squared, which is the red curve. And so it's a parabola turned on its side, and again is going out to the right. And so the area you want to find between these two curves is represented by that little shaded region between the values of Y equals zero and Y equals one. In this case, you'll integrate from the right function subtracted by the left function. So this gets you capital A equals the integral of A to B of F of Y minus G of Y, D of Y. Plugging in your values gets you the integral of zero to one of E to the Y minus one plus Y squared DY. Once you integrate this, you'll get E to the Y minus Y minus one-third multiplied by Y cubed plus C evaluated from zero to one. Once you evaluate this by plugging in your values, your C will drop, which gets you each the one minus one minus one-third multiplied by one cubed. Then you'll subtract all of that by E to the zero, minus zero minus one-third multiplied by zero cubed. This then simplifies to E minus four-thirds minus one, which is equal to E minus seven-thirds. Knowing how to find the area between curves, whether they are stacked vertically or horizontally, can be very useful. I recommend taking time on your own to practice more problems with area between curves. Up next, you will explore using integrals to find volume.

Volume (10 min 1second)
- [Instructor] In the previous video, you learned how you can find the area of a shape, using integrals. But what if you want to go from two dimensions to three dimensions? In this video, you'll explore four common methods used to find the volume of various shapes using integrals. When working with volume methods, there are two main types you'll come across. First, you have methods that focus on rotating the area on the X axis or Y axis to determine the volume. These include the disk, washer, and shell, also known as cylinder, methods. The other type of method focuses on taking slices of the area and slowly building upon itself from start to end. This will be the focus for the cross-sectional area method. First up is the disk method. The disk method focuses on rotating a solid object around either the X axis or Y axis. The formula is capital V equals pi, multiplied by the integral of A to B of R squared DX. So to get your volume, you will need a radius notated by R. Sometimes the radius is equal to the function itself, and other times, you may need to adjust it if it is not on the X axis directly. You can adjust this formula to have it be for function of Y and DY in relation to the Y axis instead, if you need to. Let's look at an example of this method in action. Let's find the volume of a solid with a curve of Y equals the square root of X, and let's get this revolving around the X axis from the points of X equals zero to X equals four. In this case, your radius is just going to be your function where R equals the square root of X. Let's plug this into your formula of capital V equals pi, multiplied by the integral of A to B of R squared DX. This gets you capital V equals pi, multiplied by the integral of zero to four of the square root of X squared DX. Note that that just simplifies to X, so once you solve it, you get capital V equals pi, multiplied by X squared divided by two, evaluated from zero to four. Once you plug in your bounds, you get capital V equals pi multiplied by four squared, divided by two minus pi, multiplied by zero squared divided by two. This gets you a final volume of capital V equals eight, multiplied by a pi. Next is the washer method. This method will be similar to the disk method where you rotate a solid object around either the X axis or Y axis, but this time, you'll have a hollow part in the middle of it. The formula you use for this one is capital V equals pi, multiplied by the integral of A to B of capital R squared, minus R squared DX. So in this time, instead of just having one radius, you have two radii, so you have your outer radius of capital R and your inner radius R. Note that sometimes, the radii are equal to the functions themselves, and other times, you may need to adjust them if they're not on the X axis directly. And like before, you can adjust this formula to be for function of Y and DY in relation to the Y axis, if needed. Let's look at another example. This time, let's find the volume of a hollowed out solid with an outer region of Y equals four, and an inner region of Y equals X squared from the values of X equals zero, 2X equals two. In this case, you'll have your outer radius, capital R equal to four, and your inner radius R equal to X squared. So let's plug this into your formula of capital V equals pi multiplied by the integral of A to B of capital R squared, minus R squared DX, which gets you capital V equals pi multiplied by the integral of zero to two of four squared minus X squared squared DX. Once you take the squares of both of those values, you then get capital V equals pi multiplied by the integral of zero to two, of 16 minus X to the fourth DX. Once you solve this, you get capital V equals pi multiplied by 16 multiplied by X, minus X to the fifth divided by five. And let's evaluate this for your bounds of zero to two. This gets you capital V equals pi multiplied by 16, multiplied by two, minus two to the fifth divided by five, minus 16 multiplied by zero, minus zero to the fifth divided by five. This gets you a final volume of capital V equals 128 divided by five, multiplied by pi. Next step is the shell or cylinder method. This method is another rotating method where this time, it focuses on summing up cylindrical shells parallel to the axis of rotation. The formula for this method is given by capital V equals pi, multiplied by the integral of A to B of two multiplied by R, multiplied by hdx, where you have your radius R and your height H. Note that you can hollow out the cylinder, like you would with the washer method by simply subtracting the inner radius in your formula. Note that the radius is the horizontal distance from the Y axis. Sometimes the height will just be the function itself, or you may need to adjust it if it is not on the X axis directly. You can also adjust this formula, like always, to be for a function of Y and DY in relation to the Y axis, if needed. Let's look at this with an example where you have Y equals X squared for the values of between X equals zero and X equals one. In this case, you'll be revolving this region around the Y axis for these X values. So in this case, your radius R will equal X because you're going from that value of zero to one and rotating it around that Y axis, and your height will be your function, so H will be X squared. Let's use your formula, capital V equals pi, multiplied by the integral of A to B of two, multiplied by R multiplied by hdx, which gets you capital V equals pi multiplied by zero to one integral of two, multiplied by X, multiplied by X squared DX, which simplifies to capital V equals pi, multiplied by the integral of zero to one of two, multiplied by X cubed DX, which solved, gets you capital V equals pi, multiplied by X to the fourth divided by two, evaluated from zero to one. Plugging in your bounds, you get capital V equals pi multiplied by one to the fourth, divided by two, minus pi multiplied by zero to the fourth divided by two. This gets you a final volume, capital V equals pi divided by two. The last volume method you will learn is a bit different from the previous three methods. The cross-sectional area method is when you cut your shape into little slices, and then add them all up together. This is great to use for very odd shapes. The formula you will use is capital V equals the integral of A to B of capital A of X DX. In this case, your cross section area at the value X is going to be capital A of X. Note that sometimes the area is equal to the function itself and other times, you may need to adjust it if it is not on the X axis, like I mentioned before. And like always, you can adjust this formula to be for function of Y and DY in relation to the Y axis, if needed. Let's go through one more example, using this last method for volume. Let's find the volume of a solid pyramid that has a square base with a side size of four and a height of four. Since the side length of the square base decreases linearly with height, you can have the function F of Y equals four minus Y. This gives you a side length of four minus Y and a height of Y. Now, let's put this to the test by finding your volume where you have F of Y equals four minus y, and you can take the square of your function to get the square cross section. So you'll get F of Y squared equals four minus Y, and then you'll square all of that. And this will be evaluated on the bounds of Y equals zero to Y equals four, since your height is four. Now let's plug this into your formula, capital V equals the integral of A to B of capital AY DY. Note that I adjusted this formula to be in terms of Y and DY, due to the function you are using being F of Y. Plugging in your function and your bounds, you get capital V equals the integral of zero to four of four minus Y, and then you'll square all of that, DY. Once you multiply this out, you get capital V equals the integral of zero to four of Y squared, minus eight, multiplied by Y, plus 16 DY. Once you solve this, you get capital V equals Y cubed, divided by three minus four, multiplied by Y squared, plus 16, multiplied by Y, evaluated from zero to four. Plugging in your balance, you get capital V equals four cubed divided by three minus four multiplied by four squared, plus 16 multiplied by four. Then you'll subtract all of that by zero cubed, divided by three minus four, multiplied by zero squared, plus 16, multiplied by zero. Once you solve that, you get a final volume of capital V equals 64, divided by three. These are not all the methods you will come across to find the volume of shapes, but they are a few of the common ones. Next up, let's take a look at how you can use integrals to find the average value of a function.

Average value of a function (6 min 57 seconds)
- [Instructor] Onto another integral application. You should be familiar with the concept of finding the average of a set of finite values where you add up all the values and divide them by the size of the group of the values. But how do you find the average value when it comes to a function? You saw earlier how you can use derivatives to find minimum and maximum values of a function. Now, you can use integrals to find the average value of a function. This is similar to the process of finding the average of a set of values where you integrate a function f of x and divide it by the size of the interval of a to b. Let's take a look at the formula you can use to find the average value of a function. If you have a continuous function f of x on an interval of a to b that's closed and bounded, then you can find the average value of this function with the formula of favg, for f average, is equal to one divided by b minus a multiplied by the integral of a to b of f of x dx. This application is best understood in action, so let's work through some examples. Let's begin by finding the average value of the function f of x equals x squared over the interval one to five. If you look at the graph of this function, you'll see that it's the parabola of x squared, and you'll be looking at those values of x between one and five. This is denoted by the blue line for the full function, and then the red portion of the line is the portion you're looking at in particular. When looking at this graph, you may be tempted to just use the midpoint, which in this case is equal to three with the corresponding value of nine. But note that since this is not a straight line, this is not an accurate method to gather the average value of a function. Let's set up your integral in order to find the average value of the function f of x equals x squared for the values of x between one and five. You have your formula, f average equals one divided by b minus a multiplied by the integral of a to b of f of x dx. Plugging in your values, you get f average equals one divided by five minus one multiplied by the integral of one to five of x squared dx. Using the power rule, you then get 1/4 multiplied by x cubed divided by three, and you can simplify this to be x cubed divided by 12. And let's evaluate this for your bounds of one to five. Once you do this, you get five cubed divided by 12 minus one cubed divided by 12, which equals 31 cubed, and that approximately equals 10.33. As you'll notice, this is not equal to that midpoint of three with a corresponding value of nine because the average value of the function of f of x equals x squared for the values between of x of one to five is equal to 10.33 approximately. Let's take a look at another example. This time, let's look at the trigonometric function f of x equals sine of x for the values of x between zero and pi. So you'll see the graph of the sine function and it's oscillating behavior, and you'll note that the function is notated by the blue line and the red portion of the line between the values of zero and pi is the portion you're looking at in particular. For these types of functions, it could be tough to tell from the graph exactly what the average value should be due to the oscillating behavior. Let's set up your integral for this function. So you have f of x equals sine of x for your interval of x between zero and pi, and you have your formula f average equals one divided by b minus a multiplied by the integral of a to b of f of x dx. Plugging in your values, you get f of average equals one divided by pi minus zero multiplied by the integral of zero to pi of sine of x dx. Once you solve this integral, you get one divided by pi multiplied by negative cosine of x between zero and pi, which you can then combine these terms to get negative cosine of x divided by pi. And let's evaluate these for your bounds of zero to pi. Plugging in these values, you get negative cosine of pi divided by pi minus negative cosine of zero divided by pi. This gets you a final result of two over pi for the average value of your function sine of x between the bounds of zero and pi. Let's look at one more example. Let's look at the function f of x equals three multiplied by e to the x subtracted by two multiplied by x cube for the values of x between zero and four. This function looks a little funky, and you'll note that the function is notated by the blue line and the red portion of the lines between x of zero and four is where you are interested in finding the average value. As you could tell from this graph, it would be a little hard to eyeball exactly where the average value should be for this portion of the function especially since it includes some increasing and decreasing parts of the function. Let's plug this into your formula. So you have f of x equals three multiplied by e to the x minus two multiplied by x cubed for the values of x between zero and four. You have your formula f average equals one divided by b minus a multiplied by the integral of a to b of f of x dx. Plugging in your values, you get f average equals one divided by four minus zero multiplied by the integral of zero to four of three multiplied by e to the x subtracted by two multiplied by x cubed dx. Using the various rules you learned, you will then get an integral result of 1/4 multiplied by three multiplied by e to the x minus 2/4 multiplied by x to the fourth. And if you simplify this, you then get 3/4 multiplied by e to the x minus 1/4 multiplied by x to the fourth and evaluated from your bounds of zero to four. Plugging in your bounds, you get 3/4 multiplied by e to the fourth minus 1/4 multiplied by four to the fourth minus 3/4 multiplied by e to the zero minus 1/4 multiplied by zero to the fourth. This equals 3/4 multiplied by e to the fourth minus 131 divided by four, which is approximately equal to 8.1985. Knowing how to find the average value of a function is a simple concept, but it could be incredibly useful. Integrals are helpful for situations where this may be difficult to do without the assistance of computer software. Up next, you'll explore using integrals to find arc length.

Arc length (5 min 56 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's dive into another integral application. You are able to discover how to find the area beneath the curve or between two curves, but what about determining the length of the curve itself? This is what you'll explore in this video. When you want to find the length of a curve between two points, this is what you call arc length. You can think of arc length as the path you would take along the function itself. This can be incredibly useful to use when finding the distance of projectiles over non-linear distances. When calculating arc length, there are two main formulas you can use depending on if it is a function of x or y. If you have a function f(x) over a closed bounded interval, a to b, the arc length is given by the integral of a to b of the square root of one plus the derivative of f(x) squared dx. If you have a function g(y) over closed bounded intervals, c to d, the arc length is given by the integral of c to d of the square root of one plus the derivative of g(y) squared dy. Let's use these arc length formulas in a few examples. Let's begin by finding the arc length of y equals x over the interval of zero to one. In this case, your derivative of yy' is simply equal to one. Let's use your formula, integral of a to b of the square root of one plus f'(x) squared dx, and so plugging this in, you get the integral of zero to one of the square root of one plus one squared dx, and so this equals the integral of zero to one of the square root of two dx, and once you evaluate this, you get the square root of two multiplied by x evaluated from zero to one, which equals the square root of two multiplied by one minus the square root of two multiplied by zero, which simply equals the square root of two. With this particular example, you could actually prove it using the Pythagorean theorem since, again, it makes a nice little triangle. Let's look at in another example where you have the function y equals the natural log of secant(x) over the interval of zero to pi divided by four. In this case, your derivative y' is equal to secant(x) multiplied by tangent(x) divided by secant(x). You can cancel at the secant(x) to simply get a result of tangent(x) for your derivative. So let's plug this into your function of integral of a to b square root of one plus f'(x) square dx to get the integral of zero to pi divided by four with the square root of one plus tangent(x) squared dx, which is equal to integral of zero to pi divided by four of the square root of secant squared of x dx, which equals the natural log of the absolute value of secant(x) plus tangent(x) evaluated from zero to pi divided by four. Now, let's evaluate this so you get the natural log of the absolute value of secant of pi divided by four plus tangent of pi divided by four. Subtract that by the natural log of secant(0) plus tangent(0), again, absolute values for that one, and then this equals the natural log of the absolute value of square root of two plus one, which is approximately equal to 0.881. Let's look at one more example. This time, let's say you have the function x equals to one third multiplied by y to the three halves over the interval of zero to four. In this case, your derivative x' is equal to one half multiplied by y to the one half. This time, you'll use the formula integral of c to d of the square root of one plus g'(y) squared dy. This gets you the integral of zero to four of the square root of one plus one half multiplied by y to the one half, and you'll square that and dy to get you the integral of zero to four of the square root of one plus one fourth multiplied by y dy. With this integral, you'll want to use substitution to solve it. Let's have u equal to one plus one fourth multiplied by y, and this means du is equal to one fourth dy. You can then simplify this to have dy equal to four multiplied by du. Plug this into your integral to get the integral of zero to four of the square root of u multiplied by four du. This gets you a result of four multiplied by two thirds multiplied by u to the three halves which is equal to eight thirds multiplied by u to the three halves. Now. let's plug in your value of u equal to one plus one fourth multiplied by y to get you a result of eight thirds multiplied by one plus one fourth multiplied by y to the three halves, and evaluate that from zero to four. This gets you eight thirds multiplied by one plus one fourth multiplied by four. Put that to the three halves. Subtract that by eight thirds multiplied by one plus one fourth multiplied by zero, taking that to the three halves, and this simplifies to get you a result of 16 multiplied by the square root of two minus eight divided by three. Knowing how to find arc length is incredibly useful for various situations, especially when the curve length is not linear. Just be cautious knowing that some of the integrals from this formula can be very difficult to solve by hand and may require a computer or other device to estimate the solution. Up next, let's look at using integrals to compute surface area.

Surface area (7 min 31 seconds)
- [Instructor] So far, you learned how to determine the volume of a shape and the arc length of a curve, but what happens when you combine these two concepts together? You can then calculate the surface area of a shape. In this video, you'll learn how to calculate the surface area of a shape by using the revolution technique. This will combine the revolution technique with the arc length formula you learned about in the previous video. This will get you the total surface area of the shape you calculate. Note, this is not supposed to be confused with the washer method since the thickness when the finding surface area is supposed to be infinitesimally small. Let's take a look at those surface area formulas. Like for arc length, there are two versions depending on if it is a function of x or y. So if you have a function f(x) over a closed bounded interval, a to b, you then get a formula of the integral of a to b of two multiplied by pi multiplied by f(x) multiplied by the square root of one plus f'(x) squared dx. If you have a function g(y) over a closed bounded interval, c to d, you then get a formula with the integral c to d of two multiplied by pi multiplied by g(y) multiplied by the square root of one plus g'(y) squared dy. Let's use these formulas with some examples. Let's start off by getting the surface area of a cone, which you can use a linear line in order to get that surface area. Let's have the line be f(x) equal to x over the values between zero and three. In this case, your derivative f'(x) is simply equal to one. Let's plug this into your formula of integral a to b of two multiplied by pi multiplied by f(x) multiplied by the square root of one plus f'(x) squared dx. Once you plug in these values, you get the integral of zero to three for your interval of two multiplied by pi multiplied by x multiplied by the square root of one plus one squared dx. Once you simplify this and integrate this, you get a result of two multiplied by pi multiplied by square root of two multiplied by x squared divided by two. Simplify this a little bit more to get pi multiplied by square root of two multiplied by x squared. So let's evaluate this from zero to three. So you have pi multiplied by square root of two multiplied by three squared minus pi multiplied by square root of two multiplied by zero squared, which gets you a final result of nine multiplied by pi multiplied by square root of two for the surface area of your cone between the values of zero and three. Let's look at another example, but this time, let's get the surface area of a sphere. This time, you have the function f(x) equals the square root of nine minus x squared over the interval of negative three to three. This is because your radius, in this case, is equal to three. Your derivative in this problem is equal to f'(x) equal to negative x divided by the square root of nine minus x squared, and let's plug this into your formula of integral a to b of two multiplied by pi multiplied by the square root of one plus f'(x) squared dx. This gives you the integral over your interval negative three to three of two multiplied by pi multiplied by nine minus x squared multiplied by one plus negative x divided by square root of nine minus x squared, and then square that and, finally, dx. You can simplify this integral a little bit to get the integral of negative three to three of two multiplied by pi multiplied by nine minus x squared multiplied by three divided by nine minus x squared dx. Now, you can cancel out those two terms to just get the integral of negative three to three of six multiplied by pi dx, which gets you a result of six multiplied by pi multiplied by x evaluated from negative three to three. Evaluating this gets you six multiplied by pi multiplied by three minus six multiplied by pi multiplied by negative three, which gets you a final result of 36 multiplied by pi for the surface area of your sphere with a radius of three. Let's look at one more example where you have the function x equal to one half multiplied by y squared over the interval of zero to two. In this case, your x' is equal to y. Since you're working with a function of g(y) this time, you will then have the integral of cd of two multiplied by pi multiplied by g(y), multiplied by the square root of one plus g' of y squared dy. Let's plug in your values to get the integral of zero to two of two multiplied by pi multiplied by one half multiplied by y squared multiplied by the square root of one plus y squared dy. You can then simplify this to be the integral of zero to two of pi multiplied by y squared plus the square root of one plus y squared dy. This particular example requires you to (indistinct). So let's have u equal to one plus y squared and du equal to two ydy. If you solve the first equation for y squared, you get y squared equal to u minus one, and if you solve the second one, you get ydy equal to one half du. Let's plug this into your equation to get the integral of zero to two of one half multiplied by pi multiplied by u minus one multiplied by the square root of udu. This then simplifies to the integral of zero to two of one half multiplied by pi multiplied by u to the three halves minus u to the one half du. Integrate this to get one half multiplied by pi multiplied by two fifths multiplied by u to the five halves minus two thirds multiplied by u to the three halves. Let's plug in your values to then get a result of one half multiplied by pi multiplied by two fifths multiplied by one plus y squared to the five halves minus two thirds multiplied by one plus y squared to the three halves, then you'll evaluate this from zero to two. This gets you one half multiplied by pi multiplied by two fifths multiplied by one plus two squared to the five halves minus two thirds multiplied by one plus two squared to the three halves, and then you'll subtract all of that by one half multiplied by pi multiplied by two fifths multiplied by one plus zero squared to the five halves minus two thirds multiplied by one plus zero squared to the three halves. This simplifies to 50 multiplied by pi multiplied by the square root of five plus two multiplied by pi divided by 15, which is approximately equal to 23.835 for the surface area of this function. It is great seeing how you can utilize previous applications to find the surface area of objects, especially if they're not a normal shape. Like with arc length, note that some of the integrals from this formula can be very difficult to solve by hand and may require a computer to estimate the solution. Up next, let's work with force, work, and energy.

Force, work, and energy (6 min 16 seconds)
- [Instructor] In this video, you'll explore some practical applications in the realm of physics. In particular, you'll focus on exploring how to use integrals with force, work, and energy. Let's begin by exploring force. Force is when there is a push or pull on an object that causes the object to change velocity. This is measured in newtons, which is abbreviated to a capital N. The general formula for force is F equals m multiplied by a, where you have force equals mass multiplied by acceleration. Let's look at an example of using integrals with force. Let's say you have a 10 meter rope with a density of five newtons per meter. For this example, you want to find the total force required to pull the entire rope straight upward, assuming the current position is having it lie completely flat on the ground. In this case, you can integrate over the weight of the five newtons per meter for the 10 meters of the distance, so you'll have capital F equals the integral of zero to 10 of five dx. Getting your integral for this is five multiplied by x evaluated from zero to 10. Plug in your bounds to get five multiplied by 10 minus five multiplied by zero, which gets you a final result of 50 newtons required to do this. Now let's expand upon the topic of force by taking a look at the concept of work. So when you apply force to an object, the amount of energy it takes to move the object is known as work. Sometimes it is also known as the amount of energy transferred. This is measured in joules, which is abbreviated as a capital J. The general formula for work is capital W equals capital F multiplied by d. So this is work equals force multiplied by displacement. Note that you can get force if needed using that previous force formula I showed you. Let's put these integrals to work. Let's say you have the function f of x equals five multiplied by x squared newtons that acts on an object to move it from x equals zero meters to x equals three meters. In order to calculate the work, you can simply integrate the force equation over those bounds. So in this case, your work, capital W, is equal to the integral of a to b of f of x dx. Let's plug in your values to get capital W equals the integral of zero to three of five multiplied by x squared dx. Getting the result for your integral is 5/3 multiplied by x cubed, and let's evaluate it from the bounds of zero to three. This gets you 5/3 multiplied by three cubed minus 5/3 multiplied by zero cubed. This gets you a final result of 45 joules. Lastly, let's expand upon force and work by taking a look at energy. Energy is the capacity to do work or cause change. Energy can be in various forms such as potential, kinetic, and thermal. Energy is also measured in joules, which, if you remember, is abbreviated as capital J. Energy actually has various formulas depending on what type of energy you are looking at. Let's look at a few common formulas you may come across. For kinetic energy, you have capital KE equals 1/2 multiplied by m, multiplied by v squared. In this case, your kinetic energy is 1/2 multiplied by mass, multiplied by velocity squared. Next, looking at potential energy with gravity, you get the formula of capital PE equals m multiplied by g multiplied by h. This is your potential energy equals mass multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, multiplied by height. And finally, you have potential energy with springs, which gets you capital PE equals 1/2 multiplied by k, multiplied by x squared. This time, it's 1/2 multiplied by the spring constant, multiplied by the displacement of the spring squared. Let's look at using integrals to find the potential energy of a spring. In this case, you'll use Hooke's Laws for springs where the force is equal to capital F equals negative k multiplied by x. In this case, k is your spring constant and x is the displacement. You can then integrate this to get the potential energy of the spring. Let's have a spring with a spring constant of k equals 20 newtons per meter. This spring is then going to be stretched from x equals zero meters to x equals 0.4 meters. Let's plug this into your potential energy equation and integrate it to get capital PE equals the integral of a to b of negative k multiplied by x dx. Plugging in your values gets you capital PE equals the integral of zero to 0.4 of negative 20 multiplied by x dx. Once you integrate this, you get a result of negative 20 multiplied by 1/2, multiplied by x squared, which simplifies to negative 10, multiplied by x squared. Let's evaluate this for your bounds zero to 0.4 to get negative 10 multiplied by 0.4 squared, subtracted by negative 10, multiplied by zero squared. This gets you a final result of negative 1.6 joules of potential energy. Force, work, and energy are all great practical physics applications when it comes to using integrals. In the next video, you'll explore two other practical applications of physics: masses and moments.

Masses and moments (10 min 1 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's continue exploring more practical applications in the realm of physics. In this video, you'll focus on Masses and Moments. Let's begin by looking at some definitions. Mass is the total amount of matter in an object or region. This can be calculated in various dimensions, such as one dimension for length, two dimensions for area, and three dimensions for volume. For each of these three dimensions, you have the following formulas. So for the one dimension with length, you have m equals the integral of a to b of p of (x)dx. Next, for the two-dimension area, you have m equals the integral of your region, R of p of (x,y)dA. Finally, for your three-dimensional area of volume, you have m equals the integral of V of p of (x,y,z)dV. Next are moments. A moment measures the distribution of mass relative to a certain axis. You can have a moment in relation to the x-axis or the y-axis. If you have a moment for the x-axis, it is given by the formula M of x equals the integral of R of y, multiplied by p of (x,y)dA, which is equal to p multiplied by the integral of a to b of one half multiplied by r of x squared minus g of x squared, and that's for dx. If you get it in relation to the y-axis, it's M of y equals the integral of your region R of x multiplied by p of (x,y)dA. This is equal to p multiplied by the integral of a to b of x multiplied by f of x minus g of (x)dx. So note that these formulas are similar, but they do have some important differences to make sure you are aware of. Both of these concepts come together to form center of mass. The center of mass is the point where a region is perfectly balanced if suspended at a point. For a two-dimensional object, you can gather the center of mass coordinates by calculating xcm equals M of y divided by m and y of cm equals M of x divided by m. So in these two formulas, you have your moments, M of x and M of y, your axes x and y, and finally, your mass. So as you could tell, both the mass and moment calculations are all coming together to get your center of mass calculations. Let's dive into some examples. Let's find the mass of a rod with variable density. This rod has a length of four meters and a density of p of x equals x squared and kilograms per meter. To find its mass, you will need to integrate your density function, so in this case, you have a equals zero and b equals four for your bounds to account for your length. So you have your formula m equals the integral of a to b of p of (x)dx, where you have m equals the integral of zero to four of x squared dx, which solves to be m equals x cubed divided by three, evaluated from zero to four, which gets you m equals four cubed divided by three minus zero cubed divided by three. This gets you a final mass of 64 divided by three kilograms. Let's move on to another example, but this time let's find the moments. Let's say you have a region bounded by y equals x cubed and y equals the square root of x from the values of x of zero to one. In the graph, you will see you have your two lines of your two functions, so x cubed is represented by the blue line, which is going up from the bottom left, kind of levels out at x equals zero, and then proceeds to increase. Then you have your function square root of x, which starts at the 0.00 and starts to go up fairly quickly and then kind of levels out over time. So you'll notice that these two intersect at x equals zero and x equals one, hence why it makes sense to look at this region. For this problem, you will assume there is a density of one, meaning it has uniform density in this region, making it easier to calculate. Let's plug these into your two moment formulas. Starting with your moment with the x-axis, you have your functions y equals x cubed, y equals the square root of x, with x being between zero and one, and your density being p equals one. Let's plug this into your M of x formula to get you the integral of the region R of y, multiplied by p of (x,y)dA, which is equal to p multiplied by the integral of a to b of one half, multiplied by f of x squared minus g of x squared dx. This gets you M of x equals one multiplied by the integral of zero to one of one half, multiplied by the square root of x squared, minus x cubed squared dx. This simplifies to be M of x equals the integral of zero to one of one half, multiplied by x minus one half multiplied by x to the sixth dx. Once you solve this, you can then get M of x equals one half multiplied by one half, multiplied by x squared, minus one seventh, multiplied by x to the seventh with your bounds being zero to one. Plugging in your bounds, you get M of x equals one half multiplied by one half, multiplied by one squared minus one seven multiplied by one to the seventh, and then you'll subtract that by one half multiplied by one half, multiplied by zero squared minus one seventh, multiplied by zero to the seventh. This gets you M of x equal to five divided by 28. Now let's get your moment with relation to the y-axis. So remember, you have your functions y equals x cubed, y equals square root of x between the values of x of zero to one, where you have your density p equals one. So using your formula, you have M of y equals the integral of your region R of x multiplied by P of (x,y)dA equals p multiplied by the integral of a to b of x multiplied by f of x minus g of (x)dx. This gets you M of y equals one multiplied by the integral of zero to one of x multiplied by the square root of x minus x cubed dx. Once you multiply that x variable through, you'll get M of y equals the integral of zero to one of x to the three halves minus x to the fourth dx. Once you solve this, you get M of y equals two fifths multiplied by x to the five halves minus one fifth multiplied by x to the fifth, and this will be evaluated from your bounds of zero to one. This gets you M of y equals two fifths multiplied by one to five halves minus one fifth multiplied by one to the fifth. Then you'll subtract all that by two-fifths multiplied by zero to the five halves minus one fifth multiplied by a zero to the fifth. This gets you a final result of M of y equals one fifth. Let's continue on with the previous example, but this time let's expand upon it to find the center of mass. So remember, you have your functions, y equals x cubed, y equals square root of x under the region of x of zero to one with your density p equals one. Then you have your two center mass equations, which gets you xcm equals M of y divided m, and then ycm equals M of x divided by m. Bringing back your moment calculation results, you have M of x equals five divided by 28, and M of y equals one fifth. In this case, you will need to find the mass, and you can do so by calculating the mass by finding the area of the region. So in this case, you have A equals the integral of a to b of f of x minus g of (x)dx. Plugging in your values, you get A equals the integral of zero to one of the square root of x minus x cubed dx, which evaluated gets you A equals two thirds multiplied by x to the three halves, minus x to the fourth divided by four, evaluated from zero to one. Plugging in these values gets you A equals two thirds multiplied by one to the three halves, minus one to the fourth divided by four, and then you'll subtract two thirds multiplied by zero to the three halves minus zero to the fourth divided by four. This gets you a total area of A equals five divided by 12. Now let's plug this all together with your different variables and formulas where you have xcm equals M of y divided by m, ycm equals M of x divided by m, where M of x equals five divided by 28, M of y equals one fifth, and then your mass, since it is the same as your area in this case, is m equals five divided by 12. So to get your center of mass, you get xcm equals one fifth divided by five twelfths. This solves to be 12 divided by 25. Now to get your center of mass, ycm, it'll equal five divided by 28, divided by five, divided by 12, which gets you 12 divided by 28, which simplifies to just be three divided by seven. This means the coordinates for the center of mass for your region is 12 divided by 25 and three divided by seven. This means this is where on the graph you can perfectly balance this region when it has uniform density. Understanding masses, moments, and center of mass are all great practical applications when it comes to physics. Let's wrap up this chapter by looking at how you can use integrals with probability.

Probability (9 min 45 seconds)
- [Instructor] Let's wrap up this chapter by exploring how you can use integrals with probability. Probability at a basic level usually does not need any sort of calculus in order to perform calculations. But once you get to more advanced calculations, calculus becomes an integral part of it. Let's start off by exploring how you can use integrals with probability density functions. A probability density function describes the likelihood a random variable capital X takes on a particular value. This is also known as A PDF. The formula to find the probability that capital X is between two values, A and B, is given by P of A less than or equal to capital X, less than or equal to B, equals the integral of A to B of FX of X DX. Note that FX of X is the probability density function of your random variable capital X. Let's look at this in an example for an exponential distribution. Let's say you have a PDF of FX of X equals one fifth multiplied by E to the negative X fifths for X greater than or equal to zero. Let's find the probability that capital X is between the values of zero and three. Plugging this into your formula of P of A, less than or equal to capital X, less than or equal to B, equals the integral of A to B of FX of X DX, this gets you the probability P of zero less than or equal to capital X, less than or equal to three, which equals the integral of zero to three of one fifths multiplied by E to the negative X fifths DX. In this particular case, you'll use substitution where you'll have U equal to X fifths and DU equal to one fifth DX. Substituting this into your integral, you get the integral of zero to three of E to the negative UDU. This gets you negative E to the negative U, which if you plug in your value of U equals X fifths, you then get negative E to the negative X fifths, and let's evaluate that from zero to three. Plugging in your values, you get negative E to the negative three fifths subtracted by negative E to the negative zero fifths. This means your probability that your random variable X lies between the values of zero and three is equal to negative E to the negative three fifths, plus one, which is approximately equal to 0.4512. Next, let's take a look at expected value. The expected value for random variable capital X is essentially the average value of a distribution. This is similar to finding the mean in statistics. The formula to find the expected value of capital X is E capital X equals the integral of negative infinity to infinity of X multiplied by FX of XDX, where FX of X is the PDF of your random variable, capital X. Let's use this in an example with the uniform distribution. Your uniform distribution PDF is represented by FX of X equals one, and let's focus on getting the expectation between the values of zero and one. In this case, you have your expectation E of capital X equals the integral of negative infinity to infinity of X multiplied by FX of XDX, which in this case is E of capital X equals the integral of zero to one of X multiplied by one DX. Once you integrate this, you get one half multiplied by X squared, and you can evaluate that from zero to one, which gets you one half multiplied by one squared minus one half multiplied by zero squared. This gets you a final expectation E of capital X equals one half. Next up is variance and standard deviation. Variance describes the spread of your random variable X, such as how spread out the distribution is around the expected value. This is given by the formula var of capital X equals E of capital X squared minus E of capital X, and then you'll square that on the outside. In this case, E of capital X squared is gathered by the integral of negative infinity to infinity of X squared multiplied by FX of XDX. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, and it is represented by the symbol sigma. So you have sigma equals the square root of var of capital X. Let's continue using your uniform distribution for this next example. So you'll still have FX of X equals one, and you want to look at the values between zero and one. As you calculated previously, your expectation E of capital X equals one half. Now look at your formula of var of capital X equals E of capital X squared minus E of capital X, and then you'll square all of that. Let's gather E of capital X squared, which is equal to negative infinity to infinity of X squared multiplied by FX of XDX, which plugging in your values, you get E of capital X squared equals the integral of zero to one of X squared multiplied by one DX. This integral gets you a result of one third multiplied by X cubed, and let's evaluate it from your bounds of zero to one. This gets you one third multiplied by one cubed minus one third multiplied by zero cubed, which gets you a final result of one third. Now, let's calculate your variance, so you have var of capital X equals E of capital X squared minus E of capital X, and then you'll square all of that. This gets you var of capital X equals one third minus one half squared. This means var of X equals 1 over 12. Now let's get your standard deviation, which if you remember, is sigma equal to the square root of var of capital X. In this case, sigma is equal to the square root of one over 12, which is approximately equal to 0.289. Finally, let's wrap up with one more distribution function. This time, let's take a look at the cumulative distribution function. The cumulative distribution function gives the probability that a random variable capital X takes on a value less than or equal to a value little X. This is also known as the CDF. You can gather the probability that capital X is less than or equal to a value of little X by using the formula of capital FX of X equals P of capital X less than or equal to little X, which equals the integral of negative infinity to X of FX of TDT. Let's use the previous exponential distribution PDF of FX of X equals one fifth multiplied by E to the negative X fifths for values of X greater than or equal to zero. This time, let's find the probability that your random variable capital X is less than or equal to the value of five. You'll use the same process as before by evaluating the integral of that PDF, but note that your bounds will be a little different. So if you have your formula capital FX of X equals P of capital X less than or equal to little X equals the integral of negative infinity two X of FX of TDT, you then get capital FX of X equals P of capital X less than or equal to five, which equals the integral of zero to five of one fifths multiplied by E to the negative X fifths DX. Like before, you will use substitution where you have U equals X fifths and DU equals one fifth DX to get the integral of zero to five of E to the minus UDU, which, as you saw before, is negative E to the minus U. Plugging in your value of U equals X fifths gets you negative E to the negative X fifths, evaluated from zero to five, which is negative E to the negative five divided by five minus negative E to the negative zero fifths. This then simplifies to negative E to the minus one plus one. This means your probability your random variable X is less than or equal to five equals negative E to the negative one plus one, which is approximately equal to 0.6321. Note that there are various other distributions you can work with using these formulas, such as the normal and gamma distributions. You can also apply integrals in other areas of probability, such as dealing with total probability, moments, and Bayes' theorem. To learn more about probability, I suggest checking out my LinkedIn learning course, Probability Foundations for Data Science. This wraps up building your foundation of calculus. The goal of this course is to have provided you a thorough review of the three main topics, limits, derivatives, and integrals. In the next video, you will learn about the next steps of how to continue expanding your calculus knowledge past this course.
